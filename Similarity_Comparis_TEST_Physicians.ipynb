      "[\"My 21-year-old daughter just returned from a visit with this doctor hysterical and in tears. Two weeks prior, she had returned from college with a cold she came down with during finals week, which turned worse during a post-grad week at the beaches in Maryland. Since she was going to be flying to Europe in a week and the cold was now 14-days old and producing green, bloody mucus, I advised her to visit the walk-in medi-center on Route 88 in Brick and tell the doctor her history so she could be evaluated for a bacterial infection and prescribed an antibiotic before heading oversees. When she came back, however, she was crying and extremely upset. She said the doctor had berated and belittled her because she told him she did not suffer from seasonal allergies. He kept insisting to her that she, in fact, did suffer from allergies and that she had better start taking Claritan in the fall. When my daughter again tried to explain that she had never suffered from seasonal allergies, he kept on belittling her to the point of tears. She told me she was so upset that she could not even take a breathe when he tried to examine her with a stethoscope. Rather than try to calm her, he instead kept berating her. Humiliated, she left the office in tears. I'm not sure what the other patients must have thought. Upon hearing her story, I visited this website and saw that others were telling the exact same story. I then called the office and asked to speak with this doctor, only to have him do the same thing to me. I could not explain what had happened because he kept talking loudly over me. I could not believe that a medical professional would behave in such a manner. I have since called the office manager and may take this further, as this man should not be seeing patients. I am not sure what the problem is, but it is a serious one, and I am hoping that he will be removed from this practice. I certainly will never advise anyone to go there, which is unfortunate, as my family has always had wonderful experiences there in the past.\", \"I decided to try doctor Borrison after Dr. Belton retired from private practice and reccomended a different doctor in the Los Ovlios Group that Dr. Borrison is a part of. I chose not to see the exact doctor that Dr. Belton had reccomended because my husband wanted me try seeing a female OBGYN. I do not generally enjoy giving negative reviews but this doctor warrants one. In fact, if one star was not the lowest rating I would rate her on the negative balance scale. OFFICE ENVIRONMENT: This group of doctors is located in several office suites within a medical complex with a couople doctors sharing each suite. It is extremely busy and the service is very impersonal. I felt that the office staff did not enjoy their jobs and the wait time was very long. Also, while I was there a couple, obviously waiting for a pre-natal appointment, were getting comfortable enough that I am shocked no one suggested they check into a hotel room. It was not what I personally would like to view while waiting in the lobby of a professional organization. DR. BORRISON: The first thing I did not find to my taste was her overall appearance the day I had my appointment with her. Her white coat was longer than her skirt and she was clearly not comfortable in the heels she was wearing. This is not the sort of attire appropriate for a professional office environment. I am a VERY tolerant person in spite of being highly conservative in my own lifestyle and I could have overlooked this had it ot been for the other issues. Dr. Borrison's overall manner was rude and I agree with what another reviewer wrote stating that regardless of all her high qualifications she would be better suited as a lawyer or perhaps in the Business world (other than the business of beinga doctor). She talked down to me as though I could not possibly be educated (perhaps my wearing full Islamic attire from head to toe gave her that impression?). She also apparently did not carefully review my chart which I painstakingly took the time to fill out in detail well in advance of my appointment and which included a letter as well as lab results from a different physician. Even after I answered her questions she seemed to forget what I told her. At this point I was still willing to give the benefit of doubt because everyone has bad days and MAYBE she was just having a bad day (or possibly hung over? that thought did cross my mind even though I have never consumed alcoholic beverages and can only speculate what being hungover must be like). When I discussed with her a medication and my dosage she said wrote a prescription for me with the wrong dose on it. I pointed this out to her and she said that I should try a lower dose. This was one of those moments when I can say I was literally dumbfounded. Seriously, she graduated from medical school and actually managed to get licensed??? I explained to her why I was currently on the said dose of that particular medication and why it would be futile to take less. Mind you it was not an odd dose or anything abnormal and trust me I would love not to have to take that kind of medicine at all except that some things in life happen that way. So she re-wrote the prescription. When I went to have the prescription dispensed she had apparently made a mistake and the pharmacist had to call her office. When I finally did get it dispensed it was for the wrong and lower dose of the medicine. I told the pharmacist to call the doctor because it is NOT the correct dose. The pharmacist did and once again dispened the prescription but still at a lower and incorrect dosage. So I declined the medicine because this was becoming a waste of my time and the pharmacist's and it was just too much trouble. I instead made an appointment with Anjali Tate, MD and never had a single problem with getting the medicine I needed at all. The treatment I received, both on a professional and personal ,from Dr. Tate was infinitely better! SOMETHING TO NOTE: Just this past March when I went for a scheduled c-section with my fifth baby and was cheking in at labor and delivery I overheard nurses talking about a patient who was on the verge of delivering her baby. Apparently they had called Dr. Borrison repeatedly and she still had not arrived. From what I gleaned from this conversation she had been given ample enough notice of this pending birth. Her apparent lack of promptness seemed not professionally acceptable and the nurses sure were quite vexed with her at that moment. Just the mention of her name gave me undeisrable flashbacks of that office visit a few years ago and how glad I was to have a very confident and prompt doctor to deliver my baby and not Dr. Borrison! I never saw the lady who was a patient of Dr. Borrison's but I sure did feel sorry for her that day.\", 'I went to Dr. Schey for the concern of menopausal bleeding on the combi-patch I was originally prescribed by another GYN. I visited her three times. The first time, 9/11/14, she was offensive with me but I took it without saying anything about it. I noticed her high handed way of communicating but did my best to overlook the disrespectfulness in which she conducted herself. Due to my concern, she insisted I undergo multiple tests, two quite painful, to assure I did not have cancer. I followed her instructions. My second, 9/16/14, and third, 9/ 22/14, visits, she was nicer (although clearly having social conversation with the ultra sound tech, which I found unprofessional) so I made a point of chalking up her rudeness with me the first time I saw her to an anomaly. Our discussions had been that once we were passed these tests, that she and I would DISCUSS what might be the next decision for me. She had already mentioned there were multiple alternatives, including anti-depressants, to handle the problem I was concerned with. On 926/14, I got a call from her Tech / Assistant, whom had already shown me to be less than competent and frequently confused. I was told that all of my tests were normal / benign and that I was being put on a new drug. I asked her to spell the drug for me, which took her 4 attempts to get done. Suddenly Dr. Schey was on the phone, this was not an announced or transferred callit was sudden, as if she had taken the phone away from her Asst. Her conduct with me was very much the same as the first time I saw her, high handed, rapid speed talking and intolerant. I attempted to speak with her reasonably anyway and wanted to discuss with her WHY she recommended the drug she wanted to prescribe, to tell her of the terrible experience I had just had with my PCP prescribing anti-anxiety med, etc. She was unwilling to let me complete a single sentence or to talk to me like a reasonable human being. I came to her for ONE reason only, she ran me through a battery of tests and I expected a couple minute conversation thereafter, in fact, it had been agreed upon. When I began explaining to her that I had had a terrible experience with an anti-anxiety med, she cut me off, and said, I know, thats why Im suggesting this.. My response was, No, you do not know. This just happened and Im explaining it to you to note in your chart and know as my Doctor. Her response, I dont know why you are being so defensive?. I told her I was not. What she called defensive was to me, attempting to have a conversation about MY health with MY Doctor. She was projecting. I had also went on to tell her that I had noticed the combi-patch does indicate a possibility of bleeding for up to six months as a side effect. My thought was that since Id been bleeding for nearly five months, perhaps we should give it another 6 weeks to see if it subsides. I was not able to get through this thought, as Dr. Schey interrupted to me to say, All estrogen supplements have the possible side effect of bleeding. If you dont mind continuing to bleed, sure, stay on it. I do not appreciate a doctor who has such vast mood swings and cannot carry on a reasonable conversation if her mood does not fit it. I do not appreciate a Dr. who has her less than able Assistant call me to mandate a drug I must take now without conversation. And I do not appreciate anyone speaking to me as if my concerns and health are not of import. This is not the way you speak with a client. This is not the way you speak with a human being. Dr. Schey has severe mood problems, based on my observations, and is unable to be even reasonably civil when her mood does not dictate it. She is willing to put you through high dollar testing but doesnt seem interested in doing the obvioussuch as doing blood tests on a woman who has bled consistently for over four months to see if she is vitamin or iron deficient, or suggesting going off of the combi-patch and doing hormone testing to get it right INSTEAD OF GUESSING. I do not recommend her to anyone who is interested in their health and being knowledgeable. I do not recommend her to anyone who sincerely wants to partner with their Doctor about their well being. If you are the type that views Doctors as the absolute and do not take seriously the fact that they are practicing medicine on you.then her God complex may work for you. Its a shame. I sincerely went to her to help me solve a singular problem. I took a lot of time out of my life, not to mention paid a notable amount of money to solve the problem. I was so hopeful that we could figure it out. She cant or wont. I will be talking to my PCP, who is amazing, and asking his opinion and for a referral to a reasonable GYN. Dr. Schey needs to make sure she does not become a problem transferring my records. She made her money..which I believe was her purpose. My singular concern was irrelevant to her.', 'This is the first hand experience of my wife who had our baby delivered by Dr. Kassenoff:\\n\\nAfter 2 years and 3 months of my first delivery experience, I can still not forget you and I need to write this letter in order to forgive you and let this experience go.\\n I arrived with 5cms of dilation on February 24th 2011 at Mount Sinai Hospital.  You decided not to send me home and asked me to stay.   One hour later you wanted to break my water which I didnt allow because I wanted to have a delivery as natural as possible.  Two hours later you gave me an ultimatum, either I let you work  (for me it was to let you rush) or I had to leave the hospital because I was taking a bed that someone else would need. How do you find this if you were in my shoes? First delivery, having contractions, dealing with a doctor that was not listening to you and the signs of your body, treating badly the nurses and the patient. My initial answer was to leave and as I was getting changed and ready I became panicked because I was not going to be able to monitor the heart rate of my baby. So in tears I decided to stay, you put back the IVF with such a rage that blood was everywhere and gave me a lot of pain. From that point I was blocked, because I was doing something I didnt want and that wasnt necessary, because as you said, the baby was not in any risk but you had a busy day at the hospital. Many hours later when the pushing time arrive,  I begged you not to make me lie down to push and again you didnt listen to me and just thought about what was more comfortable or easier for you.  After 2.5 hours of pushing we had to use forceps and my baby was out. You throw her to me with such a hard face, in such a way that I wish you had never been the first person to touch my baby. It is hard to forget.  The nurse mentioned you were an expert on forceps and now I understand why, how can you become an expert on forceps? By not listening and caring about your patients, by rushing them, by not letting the body take its time to do the job, by forcing moms to do unnecessary procedures.\\n \\nMonths later a nurse that was that day at the hospital saw me in a restaurant and came to me to ask how I was doing. She mentioned I am sorry you went through all of that, it was bad luck you had Dr. Kassenoff that day, with the other doctors of that practice you would have never experienced that situation. I am also sorry I didnt have any of the other doctors of the practice or that I wasnt strong enough to ask for a change of doctor.\\n \\nI was very clear with Dr. Adler when I first came to the practice about my desire of having a natural birth. He said he didnt understand why I wanted to go through all that pain but he and his team would support my desire. What support? I dont know how much you communicate with each other about the patients, but clearly you were not following his initial commitment.\\n \\nThere was no reason for you to break my water other than to rush as neither my baby nor me were in any risk.  As a doctor, I guess you have done thousands of deliveries and it seems that for you a hospital is a factory.   For patients, in particular, first time moms, it is one of the most important experiences of their life and it is your role to be supportive and human, you cannot imagine the emotional damage your attitude, your hard words and your coldness cause. That experience was very traumatic for my baby and me and had negative consequences.\\n \\nYou are a mother of two and I do not know how your deliveries were like but please reconsider the way how you interact with your patients, we are not cows, we certainly do not have to pay for your unhappiness with your profession or with your life.\\n \\nThere is no need to answer this letter, you can not take back my experience, feelings and traumas. I just need to let all those negative feelings get out through this letter.\\n \\nYou have a direct impact on life, use your talent to do good, it goes further than delivering healthy babies and becoming the best at using forceps.\\n', \"I highly recommend Dr. Patterson for any woman who is pregnant. During my first office visit she gave me a very thorough physical examination and explained everything that she was doing and why. I miscarried during my 9th week and I was able to get an immediate appointment the day that I called. I called at 8:15am and the Dr. saw me at 8:30. She did a sonogram and told me that she couldn't detect a heartbeat. She was very sympathetic and explained what would happen next. She scheduled me for a confirmation sonogram that same day and upon confirmation of the unviable pregnancy was able to schedule surgery for two days later that would ensure that no tissue remained in my uterus. I am in the military and will be leaving Sierra Vista within the next few months. I am so disappointed that I will not be able to have Dr. Patterson for my next pregnancy. I had such a positive experience with her as my OB-GYN, despite the less than optimal outcome of the pregnancy, which, of course, in no way reflects on her. She is very no-nonsense and will give you advice as a medical professional. I trust her implicitly and am truly sorry that there are not more doctors of her caliber. I chose her name from a list of providers from Tricare because she was the only female OB-GYN in Sierra Vista and I am so glad that she was my doctor, even if it was for just a short time. \", \"Here is a word to the wise: If you are in incredible, intense pain, driving yourself to the hospital might not be the best idea, because you could end up in a death trap called Fountain Valley Regional Medical Center. I'll try to make my story as short as possible: Monday: I quit a terrible job. It was liberating. Tuesday: Had a bit of a tummy ache. Wednesday: Was in absolutely horrible abdominal pain. All I did was go back and forth between my bed and the couch and lay there. By Wednesday night it was clear something was terribly wrong, and I drove to the ER at Fountain Valley Regional Medical Center. The Emergency Room was actually quite good. My doctor seemed to know what he was doing, I had an MRI and some blood work done and I was diagnosed with Diverticulitis, which is an intestinal infection. I was not in good shape, and the ER doctor sent me to the main hospital at about 4:00 AM Thursday Morning. Here is where things go horribly wrong. For the first ten hours I was in the hospital, no doctor saw me. I was given a full menu of food to choose from, but because I was in such pain I ate nothing. I just drank very small amounts of water, and I was on IV fluids anyway. Dr. Al-Zaid came in, a fat old slovenly Indian man, and basically told me I needed to sit there for a couple of days because the IV anti-biotics would take care of the infection. By Friday morning I was actually starting to feel better. So I started eating small amounts of food, because my appetite was returning. I still had access to the full menu of food at the hospital, but I read on the internet on my iPhone that I should be on a low-fiber diet, so I tried to maintain that. I ate small amounts, and was feeling good. All Dr. Al-Zaid told me this day was the test came back showing I had a fatty liver, and I should consider losing weight. Nothing like a fat doctor telling you you need to trim down. At about 2:00 AM on Saturday morning the pain came back hardcore, in sickening waves. I was definitely taking a turn for the worse. Saturday morning my mom came to visit me again, and saw I was in a bad state. I once again stopped eating because I had no appetite. Since it was so clear that my doctor either didn't know what the hell to tell a person with my condition, or he just didn't give a shit about his job, my mom demanded a GI specialist be brought in. After a some himming and hawing by the hospital staff, they finally got a specialist in on late Saturday afternoon. He was an excellent doctor, and told me I should be on a clear liquid diet for a speedy recovery, then switch to low residue diet, then low fiber diet, then high fiber diet. Only then did Dr. Al-Zaid put me on a restricted menu from the kitchen. So, to make this clear, for the condition I had I now know it takes a two-pronged attack to get over it. Number one: antibiotics. Those they gave me. Number two: very strict diet, starting with clear liquid, and working your way up the food chain. Well, upon admittance to the hospital, I was not told about that second part by a reliable source until SIXTY HOURS after I was first put into my room, and almost SEVENTY TWO hours after I showed up in the ER. I was given access to eight full meals, and thank god I only ate very lightly on Friday or it would have been even worse, possibly requiring major surgery. I ended up checking out of the hospital on Tuesday afternoon, almost six full days after I first showed up. It is my opinion that had I been given proper dietary advice on Thurssday morning when I was first admitted to the hospital, I would have been out by Saturday afternoon or Sunday morning and I would have been fine. I am happy to report that this was almost a year ago, and thanks to the advice of Dr. Surinder Saini, my GI specialist, I have not had another bout of diverticulitis. But I will never forget the horrible, careless, and frankly dangerous stay that I had at Fountain Valley Regional Medical center. Avoid at all costs.\", 'I take a lot of medications due to chronic pain. The first time that I saw this quack I gave him a list of my meds and told him that I do NOT want to take any more pills but I needed help dealing with panic attacks. Not only did he convince me to take two additional pills but one of them turned out to be extremely dangerous when mixed with one of the drugs that I currently take. I had no idea of this until I went to my doctor at the Pain Clinic. He was very upset with Dr. Starr and told me that I should sue him for malpractice. Aside from Dr. Starr being a moronic, poor excuse for a doctor, he has no qualms what-so-ever about making you wait (sometimes for hours) to see him. Additionally, he makes you sign a form that states that if you cancel or reschedule an appointment at any time (can be a week or more before) you will be billed for a full session ($100). He tried to bill me when I rescheduled days in advance. His assistant even told me that she could easily fill that time', 'First, the practice at which I had my tubal ligation reversal performed has two doctors. Dr. 1 has performed more successful tubal reversals, resulting in the birth of more babies, than any other doctor in the world. Dr. 2 became the first certified Tubal Ligation Reversal Surgeon in the U.S. Their practice has detailed pregnancy statistics that document the success of their patients. When we first discussed my tubal reversal, Dr. Csankany asked, Where did you find them? The Internet? What did they do, just send you on your way and say, Good luck! There was no sound basis for this automatic bias.Second, as we discussed how the procedure had gone and the results of the pathology tests, she declared loudly with sarcasm, Well, good luck! in regards to the chances of me getting pregnant. From the results of the pathology tests, there was no basis for being pessimistic. Even if there had been, the pessimism was unnecessary. Third, within the discussion of the increased risks of a tubal ectopic pregnancy, I said because of the tubal ligation. She jumped in with, No, it was because of the tubal ligation reversal. Not only was the tone used combative and the correction unnecessary (because the tubal ligation reversal would not have happened without a tubal ligation first), it was not entirely correct since tubal ligations also increase the risk of a tubal ectopic pregnancy. Finally, when I asked if a vaginal ultrasound could be performed at the HCG level of 1500 as recommended by my surgeon, she answered that yes you could, but it is not industry standard. We went in a circle on this a few times. Her previous, unwarranted verbal lashing of my surgeon and her stressing of the phrase industry standard gave the impression that she was attempting to reiterate that she did not approve of my surgeon. Additionally, I am not willing to risk the money that I spent on tubal ligation reversal on a possible loss of a tube from a tubal ectopic pregnancy due to not following my surgeons instructions. PS - This review would not have been posted if the front desk had not snickered at the question of if they have a general email address for the practice to which I could send a note for the doctor. PPS - The nurse was very friendly.', 'Would give 0 stars if I could! After waiting for 2 hours with terrible pain in my abdomen and back I was told by a nurse practitioner that I \"probably\" had a UTI and they would send me home with some antibiotics. After demanding to see an actual doctor and have blood work and urinalysis it was determined that I had a kidney infection that had turned into sepsis. It was not until then that I was offered pain meds or fluids. At that point a Dr. Taylor came in and made the completely unrelated (not to mention sexist and insulting) comment that I could be a \"runway model\" if I were at a \"normal weight\" and proceeded to ask me why I am not at a normal weight. I guess I could understand discussing my weight if it pertained to the diagnosis but all this woman kept talking about was how beautiful I would be \"if I lost weight\". Yet another dr came in at that point and informed me that they were going to have to admit me and keep me for a few days to clear up the infection and sepsis. I complained that I was glad I didn\\'t just leave when the nurse practitioner tried to send me away to which he replied \"well you\\'re young enough you probably would have survived.\" This might have been funny if o hadn\\'t been in a ridiculous amount of pain. I could go on and on about the unprofessional manner in which I was treated, but the most egregious treatment came from a Dr Ali who unceremoniously discharged me stating that i shouldn\\'t be in any more pain after asking my pain level. Obviously this was confusing given the diagnosis I\\'d received from the other dr the night before. I asked him repeatedly to explain my labs to me and he was condescending and combative when I dared to ask why his diagnosis varied so wildly from the doctors I\\'d worked with the night before. He had the attitude that I was a drug seeker and paid no attention to my comfort my health or my questions about follow up. I ended up demanding that my IV be removed and leaving immediately. The WORST offense by far was when Dr. Ali broke the law by discussing my private medical information with my sister who had come to pick me up. She confronted him (unbeknownst to me) over his treatment of me as I was gathering my things and he went into great detail about my diagnosis, my chart, my medications and treatment without my consent. I am seriously considering legal action at this point. Avoid this place!', \"Fourth time here and finally drew the line. Dr. Kang is awful, while I'm in mid sentence of describing a full 2 week series of events that was leading up to why I was there now he cuts me off and wouldn't let me tell him what was wrong and went right to tests. So since I only go the sentence 'irregular period' out he cut me off and diagnosed me with menorrhagia, when IF he had let me speak would have learned I was told it was a miscarriage which probably would include WHY IM THERE. He got super pissed at me when I was trying to explain all of my symptoms before he cut me off to just because I told him I wanted to finally find out what's wrong. He also was at fault when my daughter broke her arm and because he didn't see the break sent her home while she was still hurting only to call me while already home to tell me to come BACK because a second opinion from someone actually found the break requiring a cast. Also got in a car accident with a very very obvious break in my lower leg (bruising, swelling from air bag) the doctor at the time refused to xray it and to this day I have pain in it over a year later because I had to walk on a fractured leg. Also gave birth to my daughter 6 years ago, was never told by anyone, nor did they tell anyone watching, that I was hemorrhaging and we had to figure it out on our own when he was down there way longer than required with bleeding. Then I still never got an answer from any nurse as to why it took over 6 hours for my new born to even be given to us in our room. I hate the fact that this hospital is five minutes from my house and this awful that I actually want to keep driving to John c Lincoln instead for actual care.\", 'I\\'ve now seen Dr. Lynn three times. The first, there was little wait, and while she seemed a little short, she actually seemed interested in what I had to say. First of all, I waited for almost an hour at this appointment, and I\\'m not sure if the \"friendliness\" from before was a ruse for new patients, or if she was just ticked off this time because I\\'d had to cancel two previous appointments- which she proceeded to bring up during my appointment (the most she talked at all during my visit)- which I found to be very unprofessional and petty. Whatever the cause, I found her to be cold, dismissive, and unwilling to offer any real suggestions. She also diagnosed me with RA at my first appointment and put me on a potentially dangerous medication when I had yet to exhibit any symptoms of RA, and as far as I\\'m concerned, still have. I explained that my general practitioner had taken me off the medications she gave me because they were affecting another (unrelated) condition. She never offered to try any different drugs, and just sent me off for more lab work, saying: \"If you don\\'t hear from us, call back.\" When I did call back, her nurse told me \"You\\'ll be getting them in the mail\" instead of going over the results with me. I\\'m still waiting, over a week later. Her chances are wearing thin with me. I\\'m already researching other rheumatologists since she clearly doesn\\'t need her patients.', \"I have seen a few neurologists in my time associated to a neck/nerve injury that is clearly seen in past testing documentation, such as MRIs-NCVs-Ultrasound. I was directed to Dr. Armstron (for my complaints of chronic pain bilateral in my arms proximal to elbows, especially due to sleep patterns). He would not look at the testing I provided, discredited them without even looking at them. Told me the Fwave test for testing nerve root damage was garbage. Claimed he was the all mighty of the ncv test because he has done 30,000 of them. Insisted on insulting me because of my age, 54. Then proceeded to perform an ncv across my wrist for carpal tunnel syndrome. Had he looked at the previous extensive thorough testing he would see that his redundant test was not needed nor was it an issue of my medical complaint. I was looking to get elbow braces that would limit elbow travel while I sleep. I was going to get them through Amazon but the girlfriend told me to go to the doctor for a prescription since I already pay a large premium for insurance. Little did I know I would open myself up to a jack-as like this guy. I'll go back to Amazon. Kaiser is the worst insurance I have ever had, as well as the most expensive. This doctor also claimed that the government is scheduled to stop paying for NCVs because they are so misused and I have an opinion on that. I have had maybe 6 thorough NCVs and this wrist only NCV. It is a very very objective test when administered by an impartial person. Neurologist are not impartial they know how to administer it to the advantage to whom they play for. Neurologists should be barred from the administration of this vital test and that only technicians should be allowed to do this test. A neurologist should only be allowed to read the objective results. In my opinion this is the worst ego driven doctor I have ever seen. I will be pursuing the return of my co-pays and my time as well as running away from kaiser as fast as I can. Not only that this doctor has sent the pre-existing condition enforcers, within the kaiser domain, after me for payment on something I never wanted or complained about to begin with. If i could give a negative 5 star rating I would. What a waste of time.\", 'If I could give zero stars, I would. The doctor made a horrible mistake while caring for me and my unborn baby. As a result my baby was delivered at 32 weeks unnecessarily and started having multiple issues due to early delivery. It was the worst experience of my life that hunts me to this day years later. We spent 2 months at the hospital and all due to the fact that the doctor did not do necessary testing before delivering my baby. When I asked if additional tests could be done he lied and said no. Only after the baby was delivered and it was obvious it was a mistake I found out from a neonatologist that additional test should have been done and it would have shown there was no reason to deliver the baby at 32 weeks. Scared for life after my experience with him.', \"My wife was referred to Dr. Neleson from our Obgyn to help with some pain she has been having.  She was 22 weeks pregnant at the time.  She has been in and out of the hospital to manage her pain brought on by her policystic kidney disease.  Our doctor has been prescribing her medicine to help with the pain that does not/will not affect the baby in any way.  With her being an Obgyn I do not think she would ever give anyone medicine that would be harmful to the baby.  My wife went there to seek out alternatives to the pills since we are approaching the third trimester and she will not be able to take them at that point.  Our doctor faxed her complete medical file over to Dr. Neleson's office prior to her appointment.  When she got to the appointment he did not even read her file but instead chose to explain to ther that our baby could be deformed because of the medicine she was prescribed.  He was then rude, obnoxious, and completley unprofessional.  On another note, the staff was rude when she was trying to get the appoinment.  Dr. Neleson then printed info off of the internet about what taking her medicine does to animals.  On top of all this Dr. Neleson told my wife that he was going to fax in something to our Obgyn's office saying &quot;not to send pregnant women in.&quot;  When my wife asked Dr. Neleson about possibly trying accupuncture he told her &quot;good luck finding someone that will do accupuncture on a pregnant woman in Dallas.&quot;  Additionally, that very same day we called the accupuncurist our Dr. recommended and had the appointment.  The accupuncturist explained that they treat pregnant women very frequently.  Dr. Neleson also told my wife that her pain was &quot;psychological&quot; and referred her to a pysychologist.  This was very insulting.  I do not think that my wife put the cysts on her kidneys with her mind.  I do not think she put the cysts on her ovaries with her mind.  I do not think she gave herself a kidney infection in her mind.  We are only now 23 weeks into the pregnancy and have been admitted to Presby of Plano 3 times.  One of which resulted in an 8 day stay.  the whole point of going to Dr. Neleson was to seek other ways to manage the pain.  He did not do that or render any other service than to be a completely unprofessional, rude, insulting jerk.  My wife left in tears and was upset all day.  No one should tell a pregnant woman &quot;her baby will be deformed&quot; ever, but especially a Dr.  When my wife asked him why he was being so rude Dr. Neleson replied with something to the affect of, &quot;Oh, I am from New York.&quot;  I just wanted to let all these happenings be known.  I would not recommend this Dr. Neleson to anyone ever.  I am still in disbelief at his lack of professionalism, symapthy, courtesy, and respect.  \", 'My son has been seeing seeing Dr. Carreras for 1 year. He was diagnosed with severe eczema and food allergies and because of his diagnoses we visited with her often (up to 3 visits a month). She eventually referred us to a dermatologist and allergist (the best decision she\\'s made in the entire year we saw her). Since then, we now visit with his specialist a lot more and less of Dr. Carreras. Well, one afternoon he had an allergic reaction so i took him in and she gave him an \"allergy shot\" without explaining what the shot was and the side effects. She also prescribed him steroids to help the itching or so she said it was suppose to help. We went home that night and gave him the steroids for 5 days. He had a REALLY bad reaction to the medicine so we rushed him to Children\\'s Hospital where he was hospitalized for 4 days. His specialist came to visit with him and explained that steroids are AWFUL for babies and they would NEVER prescribe them to any of their patience. They also said, the \"allergy shot\" she gave him was ALSO steroids. I informed them of her prescribing the steroids more then 3 times in the last 9 months. They were horrified and offered in helping me find a new pediatrician. We we\\'re at the hospital because of her quick actions when she should have probably spoke with his specialist first to see what they agree on (lack of communication). I have since found another pediatrician and I hope my son\\'s story has explained how unacknowledged she is to the medical field. If you don\\'t have a choice but to stick with her (because of insurance) I would definitely make sure you ask questions and do NOT let her decide things you as a parent should. She can be pushy when she wants something done her way (sarcastic attitude) so my advice is to let her know, your the parent you make the last decision.', 'I saw Dr. Soomro once. I have suffered from Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Panic Attacks for all of my adult life. I am a professional single mother, and at times when my stress levels are very high my depression and anxiety become debilitating to the point it interferes with my day to day functioning. I stopped seeing my last psychiatrist after a change in my insurance at the beginning of this year, and since then have been off my anti depressant and anti anxiety medication. My depression and anxiety have recently reached levels that are again interfering with my job performance, keeping up with my household, etc. Dr. Soomro put me back on the same anti depressant, but changed my anti anxiety medication. I called him twice telling him I was having adverse reactions to the new medication he gave to me. He did not explain why he did not continue me on the anti anxiety medication that had worked to stabilize me in the past until I was able to work up to the level of zoloft that would control my depression and anxiety. Then I would no longer need the anti anxiety medication, or would need it very infrequently. After I called his office a second time to tell him about my adverse reactions, he instructed me to go to the emergency room because I am going through withdrawal! How dare he make me feel like a prescription drug addict when I am not stable on the zoloft and am having 2 to 3 panic attacks a day. He did not listen to me at my initial appointment about what has worked to bring me out of this in the past. I have cancelled my next appointment with him, and do not plan on returning to his office. I would stay away if you are looking for a real psychiatrist.', 'Everyone raves about Dr Fink, and yet 99% of women now a days don\\'t ever get to see him. If you are considering this practice because you have heard great things about Dr Fink, know that more likely that not, you will never see him. My review on his practice: STILLBIRTH DELIVERY at 34 weeks pregnant on 1.1.15 Longest and most heartfelt review I will write on yelp: From day 1, I never waned to see Dr Tumero, as a close friend of mine had a still birth in 2nd tri under her care. Said friend reviewed her file with head doctor (Fink), both came to the conclusion that closer monitoring and treatment could had made a difference. Fast forward and guess who I get stuck with? Yes, Dr. Tumero Details:I had a regular doctors visit on 12/31/14, during my ultrasound, tech noticed that heartbeat was slow, she quickly called Dr Simmel in and I was asked to head over to baptist for further monitoring. Upon arriving to baptist (5 minutes later, as building is right next door), my daughters heartbeat was detected by monitor used by nurse. Five minutes later, Dr Tumero (who was on duty at hospital) shows up and requests bed side u/s. U/s tech arrived within a couple of minutes and by then, my daughter was gone. Between time of my arrival, check in, blah blah blah, about 10 minutes passed. Though you maybe thinking, 10 minutes is not that long, it is when your child\\'s life is at risk. Knowing what I know now (further testing detected that I have an autoimmune disease which often correlates with still births if left untreated) I understand that OTHER factors COULD have caused my daughters passing, however, we did not know (still don\\'t) what \"the cause\" was when it was all going down,so my thoughts are: If Dr. Simmel called baptist to let them know that I was heading there with baby with slow heartbeat, why the delay in dr Tumero showing up? My daughter passed away at this hospital, all while we were present. Why was an emergency c- section not done if one minute there was heartbeat and not the next? so many questions. I know that nothing will ever bring her back, but I question the response time and how the situation was handled. ------- As if what I described above is not reason enough as to why to avoid this practice, here are additional mishaps that took place during pregnancy. I had a VERY healthy pregnancy, so my visits were short and to the point. However, there were many mishaps along the way, one of them being that a test which is done during 2nd trimester detecting abnormalities was overlooked. They apologized for that, and during that time I didn\\'t think it was a big deal, but after having lost my child, I wish that every single test had been done. Aside from that, there was a lot of back and forth with medication prescribed (Diclegis for nausea and vomiting) the office sent prescription to my pharmacy for wrong amount (less pills) so I was having to go back for refills every couple of weeks, spending more money per bottler, wasting time and gas. It wasn\\'t until the pharmacist asked me why I hadn\\'t just ordered 100 pills to begin with vs 30 at a time, that we were able to correct the issue by calling obgyn and having them send correct prescription. U/s tech with long hair- this lady is one of the most unpleasant people I have ever met in the industry. I do not recall her name, but I saw her twice early in pregnancy and requested not to see her again. I tried both times to initiate small talk (commenting on her daughter\\'s ballet pictures/ asking about her day) and got nothing. She always had a crappy face on, and was non responsive. Having an u/s done is both exciting and stressful, she did zero to make the experience more pleasant. Please stay away from this place if you are expecting, it is my only suggestion. During a doctor\\'s career, there is no doubt that lives will be lost for x or y reason. I just REALLY feel that my daughter\\'s life could have been spared, if things had been addressed promptly.', 'My story: I started seeing Dr. Kokinos more than a year ago and have spent thousands of dollars for her to cosmetically correct my varicose and spider veins. My legs now look worse than before and I am left scarred On my very first sclerotherapy session she used a foam sclerotherapy solution. I developed an ulcer on my leg which left a large scar. When she saw it she said \"I used too high of concentration in the solution\" and then changed to a weaker solution after. She admitted it was her fault. It is more than obvious that when first doing sclero treatment she should have worked here way up with concentration instead of leaving me permanently scarred. Even though there pare potential side affects with hyper-pigmentation and ulcers these are avoidable when the correct concentration is used. The weaker solution did not give me any further ulcers, but it did not help either. I have since been seen by another vascular office that confirmed the ulcer and scarring was from the concentration and I have since written to Dr. Kokinos several times in order to resolve this. To date she has not responded to provide a resolution (other than returning for additional treatments which is not an option) for the scarring (which is permanent and cannot be changed) , ineffective treatments, and the additional expense of having to seek another facility for treatment. I highly encourage others to be very careful in selecting a doctor for these types pf procedures. The next step for me is to file suit in court which will be done at the end of the month if she does not respond with a resolution. Definitely not what I had expected to have to do. I will post photos of her \"handiwork\" soon.', 'I was seen by Dr. Cooper for my routine Gynecological for the first time.Upon my arrival, they charged me a $45 mandatory administration fee not covered by my insurance and it was not discussed with me prior to my appointment.After a very short and quick examination, Dr. Cooper did not order the lab tests that are included in a basic check-up during any gynecological exam. He claimed that the only test he would get paid from insurance company for a routine exam is pap smear. He said in order to complete my checkup I should request for a new appointment and to pay for another office visit. When I asked him to take a quick look into my ear to see whether the antibiotic I was taking for my infection was working or not, he replied that my request was neither in his department nor did he have an Otoscope.He also prescribed a supply of six months of birth control medication instead of one year. He indicated that a refill can be made upon another visit beyond six months.He is obviously distracted from his main task and he is worrying about money rather than providing care for his patients. I believe it is so unwise to trust him when it comes to my health.', \"I am not totally sure what to think at this point although I have seen Dr. Taylor multiple times. He strikes me as competent. He intelligently discusses various options and medical facts. I like that he performs a heart test with all of his new patients. He has a pleasant demeanor. He took some time with me to answer my questions. There is a detail that he missed that did concern me, however. For example, I was taking a particular medication for a particular reason and I asked him to take me off of it. He wrote me a prescription to come off of it, but in the next few days after a referral he gave me to another specialist for something else, ironically, it became very apparent to me that I should not go off that med for a whole different medical reason. I was the one to bring that to his attention, but he would have had the results from the other doctor too. (Then again the other doctor did not make this logical connection either.) I would prefer if he or the other one had caught it instead of me. In addition, he did not seem concerned about a certain factor in a bad blood test result I had. I think it was caused by yet another medication. I stopped that medication myself and it solved the problem. Again, I wonder why he did not suggest this. The conclusion I am coming to is that I wish he researched more and showed me as a patient more individualized concern and time, even when I was not present in his office. I may totally be dreaming to expect this from any doctor though. I guess my advice to all is to stay informed yourself as much as you can. Do not leave it all in any doctor's hands. When I am at the office for an appointment, it seems to run smoothly. When I am calling in with a question or for a prescription, however, I have had very inconsistent results. On more than 3 occasions I have had to call back to get a question answered or a prescription filled. It was as if my earlier call was just disregarded despite someone having taken a message. That concerns me greatly. Overall, I have had some good experiences and some not so great ones with this office.\", 'I went into Dr. Lucido 1 month before my wedding. I had lost a small portion of my nail due to an infection from a splinter that I had had about 8 months prior. The nail had grown back in perfectly normal, but was a bit jagged on the edge. I was going to get a pedicure to clean up the nail, but decided to go to Dr. Lucido, which I thought would be a more sanitary option. I waited 3 hours before I saw the doctor! I told him I was getting married on the beach in 1 month and I wanted my nails to look nice. He said, no problem that he would just \"trim the corner\". He give me a shot of novocaine, and proceeded to REMOVE 1/3 of my nail down to the base WITHOUT TELLING ME HE WAS GOING TO DO THIS! I had no idea until I looked down and saw blood. I was sent home with a post operation surgical kit which cost $35 for 3 gauge pads, a small bottle of saline and I sample size antibiotic ointment. Two weeks later, I still had numbness and pain in my toe. I went to another podiatrist who confirmed that the first procedure was unnecessary, and also told me that Dr. Lucido must have hit a nerve when he gave me the novocaine shot. I still have nerve damage 4 months later. In addition, he charged my insurance company for tests/procedures that were unnecessary and that I did not authorize. He doesn\\'t care about patients. He only cares about making as much money as possible.', 'I have been waiting a very long time to get this off my chest. I had a terrible delivery experience with Dr. Gail Miller. Up until that point, I liked her rather well. On the day I began with labor pains, I had an appointment with Dr. Miller. Her office called to cancel my appointment being that she had several deliveries that day. Since I was not due for 3 more weeks, I did not worry. Later that evening I went into labor and when I arrived at the hospital the staff did not bother to call her first but went ahead and punctured my water bag saying I was already dilated and would be delivering the baby that night. As soon as I was fully dilated, the nurse then proceeded to tell me not to push because if Dr. Miller missed the delivery she would be very angry. At the time, she was attending another delivery. By the time she arrived to my room, I was completely exhausted and could no longer push. Dr. Miller became angry with me and had to leave the room to cool herself off. By the time my son was delivered he had fluid in his lungs and had trouble breathing. They would not even let me hold him for a few seconds. She mumbled something about guessing that every week must count in lung development and left the room. My blood pressure was very high and they rushed me out of the room as well. For the next few days that I spent in the hospital NO ONE brought my son to me. He was in an incubator and NO ONE took me to see him. I fell into a deep depression. I went home without holding my baby and every day felt unbelievable guilt for not having that immediate bonding with him. To this day he suffers from asthma which in not an illness which anyone in my family has other than him. I blame that money hungry doctor Miller for his sickly life and I will forever have guilt for not speaking up about her sooner. New moms beware. Trust your instinct.', 'I had a very disappointing experience with Dr. Martin. Throughout my pregnancy, he was wonderful. He answered my questions thoroughly. He was very responsive and very positive. I was impressed by his level of knowledge. Most importantly, I felt my baby and I were safe in his care. A friend of mine had recommended him after her all natural birth and I was very pleased with the recommendation. When I was 38w2d pregnant, I went in for a routine checkup. The appointment was on a Friday. After listening to the heartbeat, Dr. Martin informed me that all looked great. I was ready to leave my appointment for work when he instructs me to head to the hospital. In his words he could break my water and I would have the baby in less than 4 hours. I was shocked and worried. I heard him say all was well and suddenly he seemed eager for me to have my baby in just hours. I asked what was wrong and his response was why do I want to continue being pregnant. I\\'m \"almost\" 39 weeks so it was perfectly fine. This was not my first pregnancy. I was induced with my daughter and the Pitocin was an awful experience. I was in no rush to experience that again. So I said that my preference was to let my son come when he is ready. Dr. Martin was put off by it but then said, well he\\'ll be here this weekend anyway. Sure enough, that Sunday I went into labor on my own. My intention was to always get the epidural which I did as soon as I arrived to the hospital. Unfortunately, when it came time to push, the epidural stopped working. I wasn\\'t mentally prepared for this and I needed just a few minutes to compose myself. After pushing twice, literally for 2 minutes, Dr. Martin made the decision to use the vacuum to retrieve my son. It was not medically necessary. He was just in a rush to be completed with me as he had other c-sections scheduled at the same time. Understand that the vacuum is typically used in emergency situations or when the mother has been pushing for 3+ hours. Neither of which were my case. My son ended up with a bruise on his head which is normal when using the vacuum. However, because our blood type didn\\'t mix he was jaundice and this bruise caused an increased level which required him to stay in the hospital. I was so disappointed in Dr. Martin. I felt that the 38 weeks of him listening, being compassionate, and me trusting him went down the drain due to his lack of patience. I later found out by the nurses in the hospital that he has a high rate of inductions and c-sections. I even saw a lactation consultant at a different hospital who worked with him in the past and she said the same exact thing. I also found out that my friend had an all natural experience with him because she went into labor quickly and there was no time for anything else, not even to administer an epidural. Overall, if you know you are going to have a c-section and you don\\'t mind being induced (you should mind but to each her own) then he is a great doctor for you. If you don\\'t fit in the above, please find another doctor.', \"There was nothing special about my mothers visit. I do not wish to list her name because I am afaid that Dr. Wilhelm would not see her anymore. She had to use Dr. Cranford because Dr. Wilhelm had nothing available. Dr. Cranford was very rude to my mother and made her feel that she was beneath him and waisting his time. My mother left the office in tears. He told her that she should have been to a doctor earlier and had waisted his afternoon. He then went into the hallway and spoke very rudely about my mother thinking she could not hear him. She did hear him and was very upset. This doctor makes your whole practice look bad. He does not need to be working as a general prac. if he isn't willing to listen to the patients problems and is going to rush them in and out. My mother and I feel that she basically got no service from him. Se was also told to take an over the counter medication. He also basically accused her of abusing narcotics and my mother has never abused any medication. She is 66 years old and was humiliated by this man. He is a disgrace to your practice and should not be allowed to practice medicine unless its on animals and even that would be cruel. He was speaking to his nurse and made the comment that he was tired of seeing all of Rock's meaning DR. Rock and Wilhelms squirells. My mother does not take kindley of being referred to as a squirrell. We have given him a rating of one star and he really doesn't deserve that. We will not be back as long as this man is in your practice.\", 'From the very beginning I should have known that I was just a number to her as she only spent the minimum required time with me on regular office visits. However, after I got pregnant and needed to b e seen more often, the experience just got worse. Not only did their office not give me test results until I called (3 days after they had already received them), Dr. Carlson actually lectured me for calling. Also, my husband pointed out that she never even would acknowledge him when he was in the room with me. This is just a very small example of my experience with her. In my opinion, if you want to be a number (as she mentioned to me,she has over 2000 patients) then go to her. If you want a personal touch from the person that will be delivering your baby, do not go to her. Suffice to say, I am in the middle of my pregnancy and I have changed doctors.', 'I was thoroughly disgusted with the treatment I received from this so called physician. The appt was delayed so that the providers could get their flu shot without anyone saying a word to me about the reason for the delay. When she walked into the procedure room she was eating. She briefly washed her hands and and made a comment about my being allergic to latex and stated she had her own gloves, the nurse said something about the \"new gloves\" required to be used, then when I started to tell her my symptoms and concerns, she cut me off and stated her assumption that all of my problems were related to taking pain medication (prescribed by another KP doctor) before ever doing an assessment. I felt judged, belittled and not cared for. I was not adequately sedated and was awake through both of the procedures, at certain points writhing in pain without even a kind word, just told to be still. After the procedure she did go over the results but she was more focused on the fact that the sedation did not work than my results or current status. The exam showed I had Inflammation throughout my upper gi tract, diverticulosis and many polyps, some were sent for biopsy but after a week I still did not have the results.

Growing up, he treated my entire family for and podiatry issues we had and I rememberd him as a good doctor. He recommended I do surgery and have cadaver cartilage used to fix my problem. He also suggests sewing the toe (second to the pinky) to the middle toe. Immediately I tell him no and that theres no way I want my toes sewn together and how embarrassing that would be. He then continually tells me that there WILL be a seam there and that you would NEVER be able to tell that they were sewn together. He was so persistent about it that I eventually agreed because he, the dr, says I will keep toes that still look seperated and normal. I had the surgery and at the 6th post op appointment I had he says. \"This isn\\'t molding like I want it too. Given a couple weeks I\\'m sure it will though\". MOLDING?! Panicked I say \"No you specifically said it wouldn\\'t mold and that there would be a seam!\". He just had a zoned clueless look and says umm well it kinda needs to mold a littttle. For sanitary reasons its just healthier this way. Also at one of the post ops prior to this one, he says there might be a slight fungus starting so he wanted to have me use a special fungus medicine called Castellani Paint and that the only problem is that it was not covered by insurance. He tells me its $50 and I tell him I definitely cannot afford that and that I\\'d research it online when I got home. He then says, \"Well, let me check to see if I have some in the back I can give you.\" Of course he did. So he opens it and applies it to my toe. I say thank you so much thinking he gave this to me. He then follows me to the counter and tells the receptionist that I owe $50 for the Castellani Paint. I was stunned and when I told him that I had just said I couldnt afford that. His reply was that he had already opened and applied it so I had to purchase it. I told them I dont have 50 bucks to give you today for this he says he will LET me pay 1/2  then and the rest next week. My whole experience with Dr. Radovic and his staff has been awful. He looks at you and nods his head and pretends to care but then completely ignores anything you say. After all this they I still had to pay a bill that was more than $600, which is not anywhere near the amount they told me it would be. I eventually just paid so I can be done with the whole thing! I have had increasing pain since this surgery and recently saw an orthopedic surgeon to correct this. It really is a shame because I do remember him as a good doctor years ago, and had always recommended him. It\\'s clear and obvious he is now just another greedy, money hungry doctor.', \"Dr. Reimnitz is a rock star, plain and simple. I selected her after changing from Kaiser. I had just had a rather traumatic miscarriage experience that was poorly handled and Dr. Reimnitz started by running every test and doing everything possible to make sure that I was in perfect health moving forward. When we got pregnant just a couple months later, she was a dream to work with. First, she is incredibly kind and relaxed. Her confidence and experience (having delivered over 5000 babies!) makes even the most neurotic pregnant woman calm down and enjoy the process. On top of that, she is extremely knowledgeable. There was not a single question I asked that she did not have a very informed answer on. Lastly, she is not your average run-of-the-mill doctor, this woman is surgeon-grade excellence. I ended up needing a c-section because my little guy was breech and she was a total pro. If you have to be operated on, you want the very best and that person is Dr. Reimnitz. EVERY SINGLE nurse that checked my scar during my hospital stay responded with shock at how great my incision looked and told me I would heal with almost zero complications and minimal scarring. On top of that, SEVERAL nurses told me that if they had to pick a doctor to perform surgery on them or someone they loved, she would be at the top of a very short list. When the nurses who see patients from all over, every single day, say that your doctor would be their pick, you know you are rocking medical gold. Now, whenever I hear c-section horror stories or get asked by pregnant women how my experience was, I get to share a positive example of how having a great doctor makes all the difference. By the end of my first week I was almost 100% back to normal and enjoying every minute with my new baby. I believe every woman and child deserves excellent medical care, but with today's vast range of options, it can be confusing to know where to turn and who to choose. Dr. Reimnitz is phenomenal and her medical expertise can't be beat.\", 'I second reviewer Sara W\\'s review, Dr. Kokinos ruined my legs too. Please read the other filtered reviews before considering Dr. Kokinos. My story: I started seeing Dr. Kokinos more than a year ago and have spent thousands of dollars for her to cosmetically correct my varicose and spider veins. My legs now look worse than before and I am left scarred On my very first sclerotherapy session she used a foam sclerotherapy solution. I developed an ulcer on my leg which left a large scar. When she saw it she said \"I used too high of concentration in the solution\" and then changed to a weaker solution after. She admitted it was her fault. It is more than obvious that when first doing sclero treatment she should have worked here way up with concentration instead of leaving me permanently scarred. Even though there pare potential side affects with hyper-pigmentation and ulcers these are avoidable when the correct concentration is used. The weaker solution did not give me any further ulcers, but it did not help either. I have since been seen by another vascular office that confirmed the ulcer and scarring was from the concentration and I have since written to Dr. Kokinos several times in order to resolve this. To date she has not responded to provide a resolution (other than returning for additional treatments which is not an option) for the scarring (which is permanent and cannot be changed) , ineffective treatments, and the additional expense of having to seek another facility for treatment. I highly encourage others to be very careful in selecting a doctor for these types pf procedures. The next step for me is to file suit in court which will be done at the end of the month if she does not respond with a resolution. Definitely not what I had expected to have to do. I will post photos of her \"handiwork\" soon. ', ' It took 3 hours just to get in. The woman at the front desk gave us bad directions. We stopped at every help desk on another floor because we got lost and every desk was unmanned. Even after we rang a bell no one came. \\n\\nWhen we were waiting people kept going in before us, and even as my fiance was pacing around and almost crying the lady at the window just kept reading her book. We waited so long that I had to use their unsanitary bathroom (In which I contracted strep throat from the bathroom door handle, I later found out. It is the only place I could have gotten it from because I am a homemaker and I never really go out unless its an emergency like that was.) They said if we left the room we would be bumped to the back of the list, which made it nearly impossible for bathroom breaks, food breaks, smoke breaks, or anything without rushing. We tried not to leave at all because of that stupid rule. So we sat there watching the only station we were allowed to watch- which was Nick with an I Carly movie or something extremely lame and boring.\\n\\nWhen we finally got in the nurse was inexperienced and made my fiances arm bleed all over. He didnt know how to properly take blood and got it all over the bed and my fiances pants. When the doctor came in he asked my fiance to lay down on the bed. My fiance showed the doctor the bloody sheets and the doctor told him it was ok and to lay down. So my fiance had to lay on bloody sheets that they wouldnt change, or at least cover up with something. When my fiance offered to give the doctor his insurance information and the doctor said, \"No, that is ok.\" Later, the prescription he prescribed was not covered by medicaid because the doctor refused to check. Before we came into the hospital my fiance called and told them to get his medical history ready so that it would make everything move faster, but by the time we got out it had still been 4 hours total. So that night when we went to go get his medicine and we couldnt get it until the doctor confirmed with the pharmacy that it was okay to get the knock off brand. He had to wait another whole day just to get relief from his pain because of that.  \\n\\nThe funny part was that in the 3 hours we were in the waiting area someone was laying in a chair with a coat over their head. In that 3 hours no one came to check on that person, and nor did they move. They could have been dead and the lady at the desk reading Stephen King would have been totally oblivious.\\n \\nThe nurses did not answer my questions that was important to my health as well. They gave my fiance something to drink that contained sulfates, of which I am allergic. I was honestly scared to kiss my fiance after he drank it because I thought my own throat would swell up from my own allergic reaction. It was a simple question and they refused to answer whether or not it would be safe for me to be near. \\n\\nIn the waiting room there were two elderly women, one with a bladder problem, and she had been waiting for two hours. What if she got stuck in the bathroom and they bumped her to the back of the list? That poor old woman was not taken care of and they didnt grant her any exception with the bathroom either. \\n\\nThe only person at the hospital that was helpful was a nice lady that cleaning staff. She was nice enough to stop what she was doing and help us find our way. She should be paid more if she was the only person that could help us in the hospital. \\n\\nIn conclusion, I never want to go there again, especially not in an emergency. The staff is NOT well informed, they are very cold and uncaring, the nurses are unsanitary, the bathrooms do not have wipes to get the door knob with, and the waiting was hell. Do not go to this hospital because they will let you die in the waiting room before they would ever let you in.  ', 'Doctor Halsten is motivated by money, not a desire to help her patients.Allow me to explain. Over the course of the past five years my wife has been with the same Oncologist at Kaiser Permanente. Throughout the course of her treatment, her Oncologist was a little more cautious about treatment than we had hoped, but he was extremely responsive and involved in my wife\\'s treatment plan. Over the last few years my wife sought a second opinion in order to develop a more aggressive treatment plan for her breast cancer. This led us to Doctor Helsten. After consulting with her and paying out of pocket to UCSD, my wife and I decided that the options presented to us by Doctor Helsten, which included the potential for clinical trials with new treatments at UCSD and genomic testing, were worth changing insurance companies, oncologists, and primary care providers for. We made the switch to Blue Cross Blue Shield and tried to schedule an appointment. Whereas Doctor Helsten was readily available for consultation when we were paying out of pocket, as soona as we switched insurance companies, we were no longer a priority for her time.Three weeks. My wife had to wait three weeks for a consult. Three weeks without treatment of any kind. And so, the cancer progressed, as it does when it is ignored. The day before my wife\\'s appointment, she ended up in the ER because she could not walk. A member of Doctor Helsten\\'s oncology team consulted with my wife and recommended radiation. Then the ortho team recommended surgery to support the femur and hip which contained cancer. That actually alleviated a lot of pain. Thank you ortho team.After the surgery, still no appearance or call from Doctor Helsten.UCSD put my wife in Cottonwood \"care facility\" and because I work out of state, I was unable to intervene until after she was removed from the hospital. This action had no bearing on her directly until my wife ended up in the ER because she was anemic from excessive radiation and no nutrition at the care facility (think overmedication). At that point, the oncology team told her she was \"no longer a candidate for chemotherapy or radiation\" and essentially left her in our capable hands.Still no visit from Doctor Helsten.We went home and ended up in the ER two days later because my wife was not receiving all the hydration she needed. We did our best in between her naps, but it was not quite enough to keep her functioning. The ER physician, who had never before even heard of my wife, gave us support via outpatient IV fluids for a week. That was all we needed, but it made a huge difference. The ER told us to contact our oncologist, which I did.After 24 hours I received a callback from Doctor Helsten\\'s administrative assistant stating that because she had never seen my wife in person, she did not feel that she was qualified to recommend IV fluids plain hydration and that we needed to seek assistance from palliative care. How can an oncologist who had time for my wife before and knew of her case issues say she is not qualified to recommend fluids for my wife, while and ER doctor who has never met us can be kind enough to help us until we can get support from what is supposed to be our team?While our previous oncologist may not have been the most aggressive, he was extremely supportive, caring, and compassionate- always available by phone or email, and his office understood that when a cancer patient \"urgently\" requires a consult, they are not exaggerating in any way, shape or form.The lack of compassion and care demonstrated by Doctor Helsten should serve as a warning to all potential patients. Look out for your loved ones and consider other physicians individuals who care about treating the person, not just the disease. Find someone who respects the whole human being and understands that they are supposed to be helping someone\\'s son, daughter, husband, or wife, not washing their hands of them when they need support and treatment the most. ', \"This review is a little hard for me to write since I have had two very different experiences being a new Kaiser patient so I will start from the beginning.Being a PPOer for life I decided to give Kaiser a chance even though I had been told multiple times that it is a machine and the Walmart of healthcare. I wanted to try it out for myself and see what my own experience would be like vs taking other people's opinions. I did a lot of research on Yelp to read reviews so that is also why I am compelled to write this.Pro's:It is great to be able to email your doctor directly but at the same time many facilites have this feature available. My husband had torn is MCL, ACL and meniscus and had his surgery done at the Hayward facility. The surgeon was great! She had great bed side manner and walked us through each and every step. We only paid $25.00 for the entire surgery which is not bad considering this is his second surgery and the first time around we paid over $2k.Con's:This is why I must give them 2 stars. I have been having severe heart burn and acid reflux issues. To the point where I do not sleep at night and can barely eat or drink anything. During my first visit to Kaiser the doctor prescribed me Prilosec which had the problem under control but I would still have episodes. A couple of weeks ago I had severe heart burn and sharp, unbearable pain in my stomach. I made an appointment right away to see my doctor and she recommended that I take OTC gas-x and pepto-bismol. The next day the pain continued and after almost over dosing on OTC I called the nurse line who let me know the doctor said to keep taking OTC drugs and that it would pass. I finally gave up and went to PAMF in Fremont. Luckily, I kept my PPO as a back up plan because I knew this day would come soon. Upon arriving to urgent care I was give a GI cocktail which relieved my pain almost instantaneously. I was given a stronger prescription to help control the pain until my follow up visit with my new primary care doctor at PAMF. Upon arriving she let me know that I may be infected by H. Pylori and immediately ordered stool tests and blood work. She already has a series of steps ready to go to get to the bottom of the problem rather than just giving me pills to stop the pain. I am very satisfied with the new level of service I am receiving at PAMF.If you are debating whether to get rid of PPO and get on the Kaiser train I would highly recommned against it. Do not do it or live with the regrets or poor quality service from people who do not care about your health care needs but rather saving on cost in any area possible.\", 'First off, let me begin by saying this is the first time that I have ever written a negative review for anything. I\\'ve had my fair share of bad experiences but I\\'ve never been compelled to write a negative review for anything or anyone except in this case for Dr. Jacqueline Okada. This doctor is more interested in going home early than taking care of her patients. On more than one occasion, she left me waiting in her office while she went home at 5 o\\'clock (or 5:30, I dont remember the exact time). Didnt even have the decency to tell her patient that she was going to leave; instead, I had to ask the staff when the doctor would come and see me but was informed that she had just left for the day. What kind of doctor does this? This type of inappropriate behavior aside, I would like to mention that this is nothing compared to her gross lack of integrity as a healthcare practitioner. I was appalled not only by her lack of professionalism, but her incompetence as a physician and outright dishonesty. For months, I had been going to her with a specific symptom but she told me she performed a number of tests and that the tests had come back negative every time so I was fine and that I should simply go home. Its important to note here that she never once took my symptoms seriously and as was evident in her demeanor, she was irritated by my returning to her for the same chief complaint time and time again. My old-fashioned upbringing instilled in me the sense that I was to respect my physician, so I placed my confidence in her but my symptoms grew more frequent and severe over the months until one day I made the decision to try another doctor. This new doctor who wasnt covered under my current insurance plan (and thus I had to pay out of pocket for) was extremely courteous and addressed my complaints with the sincerity and passion one would expect from a professional physician. Some moments later, my lab results come in he (the new doctor) tells me that I should go to the emergency room immediately. Before I leave, he asks me why I didnt come in to see a doctor earlier with these complaints but the truth is I had been seen by Dr. Jacqueline Okada with these symptoms for months and on numerous occasions. If it was genuine incompetence on her part this ordeal just might be a bit more forgiveable but her actions go far beyond the realm of simple negligence. There is just too much pain and suffering that I have endured under (and as a result of) the \"care\" of Dr. Okada and the damage that has been done can never be reversed but I would hate to have another patient become victimized as I have. Therefore it is with great regret that I take my experiences to the internet and write this review. Please, if you have any doubts about Dr. Jacqueline Okada\\'s diagnosis and treatments, I beg that you go and get a second opinion before its too late and you are forced to have an operation like I did.', 'Dr. Richardson is obviously a very intelligent person and I respect him for his accomplishment of becoming a psychiatrist. His style as a clinician, however, was not a match for me. I was referred to his outpatient services after being admitted to a psychiatric hospital for major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation and a mood disorder. During my visit, he was obviously unfazed as I was pouring my heart out to him. He speaks in a very condescending tone and blames the patient for their inability to cope. As I was expressing my feelings to him, he told me that I am confusing my feelings with my thoughts and that he disagrees with my thoughts. I find it disrespectful for a professional to invalidate someone\\'s emotions in such a way, even if they disagree. At one point, he asked whether I had been physically or sexually abused. I had my mother in the room and politely asked her to leave so that I could speak with the doctor alone. After speaking with him alone about some more personal things, and admitting that I used marijuana in small amounts to cope with my mood swings, he told me (not asked) to tell my mother to come back into the room. He then questioned her and asked whether she knew about my marijuana usage (she did). This was actually a violation of HIPAA to discuss my personal health information with someone else without my expressed consent. I am 25 and my own legal guardian. In the end, he vehemently disagreed with my marijuana usage and told me to just stop. Is this the way cessation is taught in medical school? I discussed with him the side effects I was experiencing from the drugs he prescribed, but he would not take any of that into consideration. Overall, I do not think Dr. Richardson is a bad doctor like the other reviews. He just was not a match for me. My ideal psychiatrist would be empathetic, a good listener, and would express himself in a non-condescending manner. I am struggling with a lot, and at times I really do appreciate the non-emotional, tough love, \"I\\'m the doctor and I already know what\\'s best\" approach. However, after being hospitalized for 5 days and experiencing the worst depression of my life, this was not the most delicate way to handle my case. On a positive note, Dr. Richardson is very composed and did not rush my visit. I am grateful because many doctors are pressed for time.', 'I found Dr. Shridharan after reading though some reviews online. Getting an appointment with her office was fast and easy. When I called, I let the receptionist know that my son had Medicaid for his insurance and was told that since he did not yet have an ID number, (he was only a few days old) I would have to pay out of pocket for his visit and that Medicaid would later reimburse me. Assuming that they knew what they were talking about, I paid for his first two appointments out of pocket with money that I had to borrow. I would later find out that paying them upfront and assuming they knew what they were talking about was a BIG mistake! As far as the doctor goes, although my son was seen at her office about four or five times, he only saw Dr. Shridharan once. Every other visit was with her nurse Dr. Matthews. Both were very nice ladies and I feel like they listened to my concerns and advised what they could. Crystal who was one of the nurses assistant or aide was really good. Always very nice and on top of her job. She also always made an effort to make conversation and did what she could to make our child feel comfortable. The wait time was never too long, about 10 minutes at most. I cant really say that I have any complaints about the doctors and cans say too much about Dr. Shridharan because I only saw her once. However, her front staff could use definitely use more training and as a private practice, she needs to up her customer service. To try to make a very long story as short as possible, I was told to pay out of pocket for my sons first two visit and that I would then need to call Medicaid and they would later reimburse me. When I did this, I was told by Medicaid that they do not do this and that I would have to have the doctors office file a claim for payment and that they would have to be the ones to do the reimbursement. When I called Dr. Shridharans office to inform them of this, I was told that they could not reimburse me and that they would not submit a claim to Medicaid. I had explained to them that this all began because of the information I received from them when I first called. After about two weeks of going back and forth with them I was told they would do me a courtesy and file the claim and when they were paid they would reimburse me. I waited a month before calling back to check on it to give them some time, from there I just got the run around. They would tell me it was submitted but they werent paid, then they would say one was paid but not the other. I called Medicaid and was told they were submitting it wrong, then later that it was paid. They would then tell me a check was being sent or that they had already sent it. It was always a different story when I called them. Every time they told me someone would call me back, they never did. I got to the point where I was going to file in small claims court because I was getting nowhere with them. After five and a half months of going back and forth with them, they finally gave me my money back. I believe they only did this because I let them know I was going to take them to court. It was a huge hassle and inconvenience. I write all of this to say, if it ever comes down to it that they have to reimburse you, be prepared to have to fight them and for anyone that may have Medicaid, DO NOT pay them upfront!', 'Good family practice physician, but does not like to be challenged when patient asks a question. Example: wife had acute pain in flank with blood in urine (per lab report). The doc\\'s impression was diverticulitis and hospitalized my wife. When I asked the doc if it was diverticulitis, why was their blood in urine. Why would not it be a possible kidney stone? The doc told me in no uncertain terms \"There you go playing doctor again\". Well, after Kaiser gave my wife a colonoscopy, a triple \"cocktail\" of antibiotics, and two days in the hospital --- the colonoscopy did not find any problem with diverticulitis or even diverticulosis. The GI lab physician even was wondering why the family practice physician (Craig) did not consider a possible kidney stone. Bottom line: Dr Craig is good overall, but has a problem with patients who question his judgment. One of his verbal phrases we bugs me no-end: \"Oh, I see this all the time.\" Anyway, my take on practice style.', \"I went to the ER doctor Marc Toofan on FEB 23 and he basically blew me off and told me there was nothing wrong with me all the nurses laughed and carried on in front of me while I was very sick and then sent me home humiliated and sick to suffer more. So I went home REALLY suffering from something that COULD have been easily treated! But when you're so extremely sick and do NOT know what is wrong with you, that is REALLY scary. I couldnt walk without collapsing from dizziness, I was extremely weak and wanted to sleep all day. I had pressure and pain throughout my whole brain. I thought I was DYING! When he could have EASILY treated me. I finally found a Doctor who did the same things he did but actually diagnosed me and healed me the SAME day! I missed over 3 weeks of work and 2 weeks due to him. I would ask Marc Toofan and his nurses to start treating people with more compassion and with better work integrity towards their scared sick patients. I have never been through something like that in my life, and I am so THANKFUL I am past it. But I could have been past it MUCH FASTER if he and his nurses would have just done their job correctly! So even though I do not usually do this kind of thing, I have opened up an investigation against this doctor for malpractice. Zero stars for this hospital!\", 'I picked to see Dr. Mueller Kronast because of his high ratings. However, I was disappointed. He seems to be knowledgeable as a doctor. However, I did not see the compassion and concern for his patients. I saw him 2 months ago but I failed to bring the right CDs during my visit. I was later able to retrieve them from the hospital and sent it to him. I got the CDs back with no notes or phone call. When I called the office, I was only able to speak to his assistant who could not really answer my questions. I told his assistant I want to speak to him. He called but I was not able to pick up the phone as it was after hours and I was driving. I called his assistant again and I faxed my questions-twice. No response. The assistant said she could only help me on Thursdays. It has been two Thursdays and I still have to get a phone call from the doctor. I am very disappointed.', 'I was referred to Dr Cohen by another physician to evaluate a possible polyp on my vocal cord. The office staff was friendly and I was taken back to an exam room quickly, which I appreciated. There were no other patients in the waiting room, which my experience probably explains why there were no other patients waiting! When the doctor walked in, she immediately asked me when specific symptoms started, which I never had or mentioned I had any symptoms besides a providing a picture from a previous endoscope procedure. She quickly gloved up and next thing I know she was prepping me to scope my throat / vocal cord through my nose. When I asked what she was going to do after she gloved up, I got in a derogatory voice, \"Well, you came to me because there might be something on your vocal cord, how do you expect me to see it without scoping you\". Fine, then explain the procedure before you begin and ask me if I have questions. You may do this multiple times a day, but this was my first time and probably most new patients first time. I also asked if she could tilt the exam chair back a little and I was told \"no\" but no reason why. I believe she intentionally wanted to make me uncomfortable. Geez...basic manners please. I was uncomfortable (but not obnoxious) and she then proceeded to compare me to a three year old patient that she had just scoped and so I shouldn\\'t be complaining and stop being a baby about this. That was not professional and made me feel like a real loser! When I asked her how much longer, she commented \"I will be done, when I am finished.\" Okay! The appropriate answer should have been, \"I am more than halfway done\" or \"just a few more minutes\" in a pleasant tone would have put me or any patient at ease but instead made it even worse. I also had to ask her what to expect after I leave...\"how long will my nose and throat be numb\". This should have been communicated to me proactively. Or, maybe even an information sheet about today\\'s procedure would be helpful. Again, she may do this all day long but it was a first time for me and I would have appreciated more I information. Before I left the exam room, she proceeded to give me a hard time about drinking diet soda. Yes, I understand but she nagged me about it a little too long. Sorry, I am not perfect. Doctors receive a lot of training including bedside manners. It appears to me that Dr. Cohen does not feel she needs to take time to meet her patients, listen or explain what she is going to do. This was confirmed for me with previous patients feedback. While she may be very good technically and has diagnosed serious conditions with her patients, good bedside manners are just as important from the patients\\' view and a good physician has the full package. I am a successful business executive and do not put myself above anyone and nor should a doctor just because of the \"MD\" at the end of their name. A patient / physician relationship should be a partnership .... Speaking and Listening to each other in a friendly and polite manner and deciding together a course of action. I will not see Dr Cohen again nor will I recommend Dr Cohen. I will also let my referring physician know of my experience with Dr. Cohen.', 'This doctor walked in, did not review the findings of my MRI and had not seen it before. Looked over his shoulder at it, told me my options and that I could get a second opinion, asked to see me walk the two steps that was ALL I could give him, move my most affected leg as much as possible and my toes. That was ALL he did for a billing and report he entered as a most thorough EXAM detailing critical vitals that he DID NOT PERFORM. He used info from other reports to complete his and was so fast when he spoke to me and my husband we could not keep up. He then, after maybe 7 minutes, led us out of his office to his nurse to be scheduled! I left still miserably in pain and with no info as to my condition but that he would operate ONLY on ONE of my \"many conditions\" as he put it. No explanation as to the others or if or when they would be addressed. I would not elect surgery from anyone this impersonal and who falsifies reports to make himself look so thorough when he was SO brief it makes you dizzy! It was obvious by the \"set up\" in the office, ready to schedule me in two days or two weeks, that the importance is on getting the patient in, seeing them as briefly as possible without asking a single question as to if the patient understands or has questions of their own, that this \"assembly line\" process of get them and get them billed is the main focus of his practice!', 'Having had my first seizure, I was scared and unclear of the path that would be taken Doctor Terranova (and I use the term doctor loosely) came in to the hospital obviously in a hurry. He had little if any time to explain anything to me. I actually ran after him saying I had questions which remain unanswered. He ran from the room and answered a phone call. He never returned. He was the rudest \"doctor\" I have ever encountered. His bedside manner and rush to run from the room had me unsure of even the diagnosis. He gave me a prescription which he said to take. When I asked of side affects or what I should watch for, he told me I was stressed and left the room. Well that pill had me at toxic levels within days and back to see another true DOCTOR. I have never felt so strongly that I have ever wrote a rating or felt the need to. Clearly someone needs to say something. Make a clear choice for yourself and do NOT choose this man. If I can save anyone from the disrespect and rude behavior , then this review was well worth it.', \"My sister was a patient of Dr. Patterson's. She had gone to him for about 25 years and trusted him completely. When she was about 48 years old she began to have difficulty breathing and seemed to be coughing more than normal. She told Patterson of her difficulty to which there was no other response than him ordering a hand held inhaler. This did nothing to relieve her difficulties. I tried to get her to go see another doctor but she trusted him and said she would try what he suggested. Over a period of two years she became worse and began having back pain, She was referred to a pain doctor, She began having difficulty walking for which she was referred to a neurologist. Still with no relief she was referred to another pain management doctor. After being referred to approx 5 other doctors and suffering excruciating pain he finally referred her to a psych doctor and told her husband he thought it was all in her head. Three weeks later at the age of 50 she died with cancer with bone metastasis. I know he could not have prevented the cancer, however she could have received proper treatment for her diagnosis which would have not only slowed the progression of the cancer but she would not have suffered as much as she did over the past two years. I feel Dr. Patterson did not perform prudently as a physician in the capacity he occupies. I am a registered nurse and I have not seen such neglect of patient care. He has tried to cover his tracks by saying x-rays did not show anything. The truth is, they indeed did not show anything because he failed to get any x-rays or labs on her. She told me herself she didn't even have any basic blood work done in nearly a year before her death. Shame on you Dr. Patterson. your complacent behavior caused the early death of a lovely person who was loved by many. You should have been sanctioned in some way for your neglect. Her name was Maida (Kippy) Dunn and her husband Pete Duranowski has suffered tremendously monetarily and emotionally.\", 'Just received a telephone call from Kaiser that I owed over $1,000k in deductible for bills dating back to September. It is now late February. I did not receive this phone call until 2 days after I complained about KP not providing standard blood work and my daughter having to wait almost two months for a physical. I find the timing ironic. Also the fact that I have received every piece of mail from KP EXCEPT the billing. Those bills were send to an address I had more than 20 years ago!! I would strongly advise when you go to KP for anything except for what the Affordable Health Care mandates, to check what the deductible will be. KP claims to be affordable, but I do not see close to $10,000 a year for insurance premiums, co-pays and deductibles for two people as being reasonable by any definition.', 'Stay away from Dr. Tracy! He will do whatever he can to keep from referring you to a specialist and will always suggest doing nothing when it comes to preventative medicine and testing. He suggested that I have a PSA test only once every few years because there were \"too many false positives\". I ignored his advice and had a PSA test done every year. A few months after his dangerous \"advice\" my PSA began to rise. After 6 months it continued to go up. I had a biopsy which showed some aggressive cancer in the prostate and had surgery 2 weeks ago. The surgery was very successful. If I had taken Dr. Tracy\\'s advice and waited 2-3 years for the next PSA test I would definitely have had stage 4 cancer and a very grim prognosis. This was not the first time he made a bad diagnosis with me but it was the last since I left Kaiser Permanente after the PSA incident. He also resisted referring my wife for a colonoscopy even though she has a family history of colon cancer. I highly recommend avoiding Dr. Tracy if you value your health.', 'When I first walked into Dr. Careagas office, my idea was to shop around and gather competitive quotes in order to make my decision on who would be performing my procedure. Once I met with the doctor he explained the procedure in detail and answered all of my questions. During his consultation, he demonstrated patience and knowledge. I then went on to meet with Mrs. Lourdes Careaga, the director of operations who went over the cost and finance options. The warm welcome I received throughout my entire consultation made me feel so much at ease that I immediately decided I was not going to waste my time in shopping around and I signed the contract right then and there! I was beyond excited to have my surgery. I was literally counting down the days. On the day of my surgery, as Im getting ready to go into the operating room, the doctor comes in and tells me that my sugar levels were very high and that he unfortunately could not perform the surgery until they had been regulated. I experienced complete devastation as Im sue you can relate to anxiously awaiting something so badly, being so close to it and not getting it! This was a major step back for me since I had to go and see an endocrinologist, get on medication and begin to monitor my sugar levels very closely. Dr. Careaga advised that it would take at least 3 months to get my levels to where they needed to be in order to perform the surgery. The emotional support that I received from both Dr. Careaga and Lourdes throughout this time was remarkable. They would check in on me once a week to see how I was doing both physically and emotionally. This in itself was priceless for me. Although this has no relation to my surgery, I remember being at happy hour in the Gables one evening and receiving a message from Lourdes (clearly past office hours) to see how I was doing. I shared this with my friends and they were in awe at her attention to detail! I am incredibly proud to say that with determination and a strong mindset, I regulated my sugar levels within a month and was able to have my procedure. I could not be any happier. Dr. Careaga has demonstrated his professionalism in many ways. He is very meticulous and this is imperative when having any type of procedure done. His office staff is amazing and I will begin with Lourdes, which happens to be his wife, the support that she extended to me was unbelievable. She was always available to answer any questions or concerns I may have had. Lisandra, the surgical assistance was patient, very accommodating and understanding. Patty, the office manager, always has a smile on her face and is very efficient. Andrea who assists the doctor in consultations and handles the labs was very nice and also accommodating. Annette who takes extremely good care of you in the recovery room (this for me was crucial, as you want someone that treats you well and nurtures you during this time) was outstanding. Jenny, the therapist that does the lymphatic massages, is amazing! She is soft spoken, walks you through the massages and provides suggestions and advice on what to do and not to do after your procedure. I am extremely satisfied with Dr. Careagas office. I have authorized Lourdes to give my name and number to any patient that wishes to hear my story in full detail and wants or needs additional reassurance.', 'Copy of letter I sent to kaiser.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Whom it may concern. \\r\\n \\r\\nI would like to express how upset I am at my first and last (to date) visit to the clinic in Evergreen, CO. I came in Friday 4-29-2011 with a sore throat. I was seen in a timely manor. Being  a new patient  the nurse advised me that I needed to set up an appointment and choose a Primary Care Physician. I was informed that they could take care of that right away. I made it abundantly clear that I did not want to do it at that time. I was hesitant to do it at all not seeing the need. While being examined she was insistent on the fact that I needed it done. I conceded that maybe I should but that now was not a good time and I could come back later in the day or set an appointment for next week.  As the examination went on she repeated how important it was for me to see a Primary Care Physician. The Primary Care Physician could explain the lab work that was in my file.Work that I had  gotten done for my Dermatologist. Again I repeted now was not a good time I had somewhere to be. She took a swab of my throat and said she would be right back. Some 20 min later she stuck her head in and told me that the doctor would be in in a few min. My thought was why am I seeing a doctor for a nurse visit? When the Doctor came in she started to go over the tests I had in my file.Tests had nothing to do with why I was there at the time.  I explained that I was now short on time and had hoped this was to be over soon. She then started to examine me. As she did she joked that \"bet it feels like you are being forced to see a doctor.\" I told her YES it did. She told me that the nurse was concerned for me. After the examination the doctor told me the short test had concluded I did not have Strep and my throat was sore. She did not give me a prescription for anything, nor did she tell me that they do not give out antibiotics for this. She in fact did not give me any advice at all! Just sent me on my way after almost 2 hours in your office.  \\r\\n \\r\\nYour nurse, while thinking she was acting in my best behalf was NOT! I DO NOT need a another mother. She WASTED my time! The doctor that I did not need to see did nothing for me and again wasted my time! I am furious that I spent almost 2 hours in your clinic and only got hassled, nothing productive happened! MY TIME WAS WASTED! What am I paying  for? I was assessed a Co-Pay, I will not pay it! I would like your help to have it removed from my file. \\r\\n \\r\\nI have been a new patient for almost 5 months this is the second doctor I have seen. So far I have had a problem at every turn when I have dealt with your company.

I remember being terrified, but I also remember his comforting nudge along the way. He even took the time to speak with me when I had questions over the phone before the operation. He's a gem, I almost did not show up, but his voice in my head, assured me that it would be okay. After the operation, he came to visit and made sure the nurse fluffed my pillow and checked on the pain medication to ensure I could rest comfortably before he left. How many doctors do that? Even the after appointment was comforting, if I did not see other patients there, I would have swore I was the only one. Thank you for being that doctor that I needed Dr. Williams, during one of the most devistating times of my life.\", 'Dr. Fealy has been a complete disappointment; I don\\'t go to the doctor too frequently but when I go I expect someone who shows interest in my health, Dr. Fealy is not that kind of doctor.

He gave me a rough internal exam without using any lubrication, causing me pain and discomfort. I felt violated. When my water broke, he ordered me to the hospital and when there, he told me that it was terrible that my water broke and that I wasn't feeling any contractions, as if it was my fault. He urged me to wait to receive the epidural and when I couldn't withstand the pain for very long, he mocked me for getting it so quickly. He told me I might need a C-Section, but left the room without reassuring me that a C-Section would not be so bad. When I did end up needing a C-Section, instead of comforting and calming me, he told me to pull myself together. The whole time it felt like I was just getting a C-Section so that he could go home to his family BBQ (my son was born July 4th weekend). During his visits to me at the hospital, when I asked about what I was forbidden from doing, he made many sexist remarks about women and grocery shopping. At subsequent visits, each time he spoke to me about my C-Section, he mentioned a different reason. While the reasons were not mutually exclusive, it was strange how he kept changing the reasons for the C-section. He made me feel guilty for being upset about the C-section by saying that my son was beautiful and healthy. While I am very thankful that my son is so beautiful and healthy, I will always wonder whether I truly needed an extremely invasive procedure that had a difficult recovery or if my doctor was just rushing out the door. Because of his terrible bedside manner, he never gained my trust as a doctor. The worst part is, I know women who are his biggest fans, which makes me think that he chose to victimize and bully me in particular. I truly think he is a misogynist who chose the profession of obstetrics because he likes seeing women uncomfortable and in compromising positions.\", 'DR. Kuenstler was the first doctor I had been to in years, simply because i don\\'t usually get sick. I went in for pancreantitis which was diagnosed at the ER. He asked some questions did a little pushing on my stomach, had blood drawn and said they would call with results in a couple of days. That was on Monday, I never heard from them after calling several times and leaving messages with his nurse on Thursday, I finally got a hold of her Friday afternoon. Then she said \"yea I tried calling you Thursday, but there was no answer\". No you didn\\'t, and if you did you should have left a voicemail. I went back in because of more pain in a new area and diarrhea a week later and had lost 14 lbs. which I was told is normal and it was still just the pancreantitis. I went in as a walk in so couldn\\'t see Dr. Kuenstler instead saw Dr. Rodriguez. I was shocked at how much he argued with me when I asked if it could be something else that was causing the pain, and that all of this was new pain, and the diarrhea was new as well, but he stuck to just pancreantitis.. I have to go back to have a third set of blood work done and I\\'m pretty sure I will be finding a different doctor from now on. Dr. Kuenstler wasn\\'t too bad but if I can\\'t see him in an emergency then what\\'s the use', \"I got pregnant with my second child and really wanted a lady doctor. With the best intentions I came across Dr. Lacome's name. The Miramar location was something else that interested me. My high hopes were quickly shattered when even a few of the front desk staff were rude to me. Later on I came to find out my doctor was no better. During a visit, she informed me that my Pap smear showed unusual results in the coldest most insensitive matter. At the time I was nearly 28 weeks pregnant and thought that maybe I was being over sensitive and that the sarcastic, aggravated attitude coming from her was in my mind. She was very dismissive of the results and told me to wait until I give birth for further analysis. As it is I have a history of premature labor, early on she'd asked me to let her know when I was 15 weeks pregnant to begin shots that would help prevent this from happening again, but I could not start them due to the outrageous insurance cost. Then I had a scare: I lost my mucus plug. I wasn't sure if it was exactly that at first, though. I thought it was normal fluids from being pregnant. A few days later while reading something online I realized it could be something serious. Worried, I called Dr. Lacome. I reached her on her day off and, once again, she was rude and sounded bothered and aggravated. Over the phone, she said she didn't understand and that she could do nothing for me regarding something that happened 3 days ago. She then ordered me to the hospital. I was released and told nothing was wrong, to just drink plenty of water and not to have sexual intercourse. At my next doctors visit I was to be checked for the abnormal cells found in my cervix as she wanted to see them through a magnifying glass. Instead, she checked and told me she found that my cervix was 1 cm dilated. She spoke nothing of the cells that she had me so worried over. It wasn't until then that she mentioned a more affordable injection, which I went and got right away. The first shot I received, administered by a nurse, was given to me on my sciatic nerve. I've been limping ever since. When I told Dr. Lacome she started up again with her aggravated attitude.She went so far as throwing my chart and telling me to not take the shot then. She had no concern for my hip and was just plain unprofessional. I suggested to try the shot one last time in hopes that it wouldn't mess me up and that I could keep taking precautions it didn't even come from her. She then called in the same exact nurse that gave me the first shot. Luckily, she got it right that time. Fed up with how Dr. Lacome has treated me, I decided to change doctors in the same office keeping my fingers crossed that he'll be different. Unfortunately your actual doctor isn't always the one to deliver your baby, it's the doctor on call so there's a chance it will be Dr. Lacome. I'm really hoping it's not. As a patient, you look to your doctor for help and support. I simply can't understand why she would even pursue a field where she's in a position to help others as she has an awful temper and zero people skills. I wouldn't recommend her to my worst enemy--no expecting mother should be treated the way that she treated me.\", 'I first Met Dr. May after being flown in by emergency helicopter. After over 1 year of trying by my current cardiologist and 2 years of my trying, it was finally proven that he in fact did not dictate Dr. May was on his way to his 2 week vacation, he left me in the hands of a colleague. I was told I had a rare illness, given two prescriptions and sent home the same day. I immediately began having severe chest pain, but was not given the necessary nitro to help me. I called his office for help, no one would see me. I was re-admitted to CICU. I finally met him after two weeks. His first words were, \"Something like how happy to meet me, he met my crotch the other night. I remind you, I was naked on a table in a room of strangers, having just been unloaded from a helicopter, not knowing if I was going to live or die, and all he could talk about was my crotch. I was humiliated and wanted to crawl out of the room. He put me on a bad medicine, I suffered because of him.BEWARE BAD DOC', 'Dr. Tolar makes assumptions, especially if you are a female patient. If you are continually fatigued it\\'s all in your mind (for years). You just need to get more sleep and excercise more. Only when blood work comes back that proves there is something more. After a diagnosis of fibromyalgia by a specialist, his response was, \"Well fibromyalgia is just a diagnosis they give when they can\\'t make another diagnosis.\" Someone needs to read current research on the topic. My husband has also been seen by him and felt like Dr. Tolar just went through the motions. They \"market\" services from the time you walk in the door. Allergy testing, etc. They will refer you to prividers with no regard to whether they are in your provider network or not. Every specialist they have referred me to was not in my network, even though I was assured they were. I quit taking their referrals. Until we gave up on the practice altogether. The last visit I waited over an hour. We no longer uses this practice.', \"I am 35 weeks pregnant and had been seeing Dr. Freeman at Arboretum OBGYN. My insurance benefits are expiring around my due date and will have to elect cobra coverage once the benefits expire. At my visit earlier in the week I gave the doctor a heads up about the transition and told another person in the office that deals with insurance that I have the ball rolling in regards to the cobra application and coverage. Today I received a phone call from the practice manager who had informed me of two things: since my insurance changed over from BCBS to Cigna as of the first of the year, my deductible had changed and that I owe an additional $1400 BEFORE my next appt (5 days from now) and also that if my insurance cannot be verified on the date of delivery (even though cobra is retroactive) that they will not authorize treatment for a pregnant woman in labor. I have decided to switch practices altogether -- even though I'm close to delivery -- due to such unethical and money hungry behavior. I do NOT recommend this practice to anyone.\", 'Dear Marin, I know this letter of gratitude and appreciation is long overdue and I wish I would have told you this sooner, I am sorry. When I walked into your office for my routine check at 19 years of age, I did not know what was wrong with my health but I told you about the symptoms I had been experiencing. I was gaining weight, losing my hair, constantly tired and fatigued. You felt around my neck and found a 1.6 cm nodule on my thyroid. I remember it like it was yesterday, you said, do you know you have a nodule on your thyroid? At the time, I did not know what a thyroid was or how important and valuable this organ is to our bodies. I know that if it was not for you, there would be a strong possibility I could have went undiagnosed. It was just the day prior to my visit with you that I went to my primary doctors office complaining of the exact same symptoms and nothing was figured out or detected. I was sent to an endocrinologist for a biopsy and found out I had thyroid cancer. I ended up having a complete thyroidectomy followed with the radioactive pill. It took me a long time to fully recover because I could not take synthroid until my body recognized I did not have a thyroid first, then once I started to take synthroid, It took a while for my body to adjust. I will be 28 this year; I want you to know how grateful I am to have you as my practitioner. I have been routinely tested for any reoccurrence, it is always negative. I live a healthy life physically and enjoy watching my daughter grow with each day, Gianna will be 5 this year and you delivered her into my life. I will forever be grateful for your support, encouragement and dedication. I have been inspired by you, and Dr. Feldman to give back to the community the way you do and I hope one day I can work with you as a nurse. You are an amazing physician and anyone who has the chance to be in your care will understand exactly why I feel the way I do. You are one in a million; you will always be the angel who looked after me and my family. Thank you, Thank you, thanking you forever. I do not know why I didnt tell you this or express this to you when everything happened or over the time that has passed. Im very sorry.

I've been married for almost 4 years now and realized something might be wrong because I wasn't getting pregnant. I was 27 years old and my husband 28, what could it possibly be I was telling myself. I went to see a rei dr in Orange County and the first thing he said was my husbands sperm count was low and my amh was lower than what he would like to see it at my age and that I needed ivf and not to waste my time on iui. I was in complete shock, I left the Drs office in tears. How could this happen to me? My aunt had told me about Dr. Sami Jabara and how he has helped so many of her friends and coworkers so I called that day and made an appt. The first day I met him he was so kind. All my nervousness and bad thoughts went away when I finished talking to him. He is such a wonderful compassionate dr and I truly believe it was a blessing meeting him. He told me he did not want to rush into ivf, but to atleast try iui a few times. We did, and that didn't work out. I ended up being a very difficult patient to say the least. From hyperstimulation to miscarriages I was exhausted and ready to give up. I figured if God didn't want me to have a kid it just wasn't meant to be. He mentioned to me that we could do genetic testing, and try another round. I am happy to say I am now almost 12 weeks pregnant :) and he still calls to check up and make sure everything is going ok and if I have any questions on my medicication. Even the nurses are absolutely amazing and so helpful. I would call them and freak out all the time with questions I have after googling and they would be nothing but understanding and helpful. When you go into his office and see patients at 6 am waiting for him, that should tell u he is worth seeing. If you struggled with infertility for a while or just found out you do, I truly reccomend you see him. Dr. Jabara, If you are reading this, I wish every dr is like you.

Not really any during the second either. BUT, he said I had extra amnio fluid, which would most likely cause early delivery, so when my water broke at 1 day short of 37 weeks, we weren\\'t surprised. However, he never looked into the cause of the extra fluid. My daughter was born with a major heart defect and sealed nasal passages caused by a genetic syndrome. He didn\\'t see that during any of my 3 ultrasounds? We could have consulted cardiology and delivered at the hospital that knew what to do! When she wad a year old, he told me the syndrome she had been diagnosed with was \"made up\" by the hospital so I would think they knew what they were doing. He asked if I would do an interview on film about my daughter and her experiences. During this, he told me that I needed to take better care of my husband, and that my belief that my children always come first is wrong. My husband should always come first. A week later, he called me to say that he had discused my case with his peds friends and they all agreed that my daughter was unsalvageable, and I should just concentrate on my \"two good kids\". I was speechless and just hung up, but I never went back. His office staff were all very sweet, though.', 'Dr. Gosman performed the placement of tissue expanders immediately after I had double mastectomies (same surgery). Based on the interactions Ive had with her and the quality of her work, I would highly discourage others from using her for breast reconstruction. I had no problems with or hesitations about her after my first consultation, but things changed when my surgery happened. I was told she was going to come see me before my procedure and mark me up so I knew what to expect, but that didnt happen, I never even saw her on the day of my surgery. I had one plastics post-op check while in the hospital done by a male resident Id never met, and all office visits and tissue expansions were done by her PAs. The next time I saw her was 5 months later to discuss my next and final surgery to replace the expanders with implants. She was running 45 minutes late and then only spent 8 minutes with me. I was not happy with the position of my expanders and when I expressed my concerns to her, she brushed them off and told me she could make some slight adjustments during the next surgery. I left the appointment not knowing what size or profile of implant would be used and feeling very doubtful that I would be happy with the results if she performed the surgery. I decided to seek a second opinion and ended up having my tissue expanders redone. While Dr. Gosman was never outright rude to me and did no irreversible damage, my case was not complicated yet I had to go through an additional surgery. For such a significant procedure on a private body part, I have come to expect a much higher level of compassion and quality of work than Dr. Gosman provided.', 'Typical bad HMO doctor who wants depth of patients for billing but has no interest in them or providing care. Arrogant, indifferent, disinterested. Failed to take proper medical history, and when asked about this, gave the patient a bored look. Had to THRUST list of current medications at him (of course, this should have been taken by his MA, but for some reason, probably because her English was virtually non-existent, his MA was similarly disinterested in taking a history). When told that there were several conditions not discussed, Crawford said \"Too bad -- we\\'re out of time\". He had the MA administer a routine Tetanus shot, and I heard the vaccine hit the floor from the defective syringe. When this was pointed out to the MA, she denied it three times until I mopped up the solution with a tissue. \"Oh -- I show eet too da doctah\", she said, returning with \"Doctah he say is OK\". Needless to say, I had to be re-inoculated by my new primary. Crawford never followed up on several further appointments he said I should have, nor did his office give me the releases to obtain my medical records. I e-mailed Dr. Crawford a week later, through the Kaiser network, regarding these matters -- are you surprised if I tell you that he never responded. And the horse your rode in on, Dr. Quackford.', \"I went to see Dr. Horgan because I was referred by my treating Dr and he felt Dr Horgan would be able to help me out with the pain I was having. Both times I went to his office, I could say I spoke to him no more than 10 minutes. He had his assistant go in and analyze me. I kept telling them the pain I was having and I felt like they did not believe me. I should of turned away when I saw what type of practice they ran. I had surgery and HE NEVER went in to see me while I was in the hospital, so up to now, I don't know what his finding was. I was seen at the hospital and released by a nurse practioner. He never went in to see me or his assistant. I was released the following day. I had liproscopic surgery. I tried calling the Dr's office today and was told by staff that he is too busy and was in alot of meetings so he could not return my call or able to answer my concerns. I did place a call to his office on Tuesday, the day I was released from Hospital and no call up to now. I will not be going back for my follow up and I called my Dr's office that referred me to him and I will follow up with him. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS DOCTOR AT ALL. HE IS DOES NOT HAVE GOOD BEDSIDE MANNER. I did call my insurance and issued a complaint against him.\", \"I have to agree with the other reviews. I went to Dr. Carlo pregnant a few years ago. It was my first pregnancy and she rushed through my first appointment. I could barely get in any questions all she kept saying was for me to read the paperwork she gave me. I felt completely rushed. I decided to terminate the pregnancy weeks later and I told her about it. I was In a bad place at the time and it was something I decided to regretfully do at that time. I came back a year later pregnant again, with every intention on keeping the pregnancy, she not only remembered me, but judged me from the moment she saw me. I heard her talking about me to the medical assistants in the office hallway. Not only did I find that completely unprofessional but isn't that against doctor patient privelage? I was so uncomfortable, that I reported her to another doctor at the practice although I never heard of anything was said. I will not go to that practice anymore because of this doctor. She is extremely rude, has poor bedside manner and quite honestly comes off very snobby. Not what I need in an OBGYN. Sad too because the rest of the doctors there are very nice.\", 'Got appointment the next day. Just moved to Las Cruces and had a recent MRI and X-rays in hand from my previous physician. When I went back into the treatment area, the staff refused to let me see the doctor until I took another set of X-rays. Once the doctor came in, he did not do anything stating that they need a new MRI even though my other one was less then a month old. Nothing was done except to reschedule the MRI. Over a month later, I received a phone call from the staff stating the insurance company refused to approve another MRI. By then I had already seen another physician, had surgery, and was back to work, doing great. I would not recommend this organization to anyone. All they care about is money and it cost me $450 just to be told they would not do anything without another MRI.', \"This Dr. was very friendly, helpful and informative prior to my surgery.  After the surgery, when I had a fever for days, he would NOT return my calls after repeated attempts.  He never showed up when I was admitted to the hospital for post op infection and I could only get through to his associalts.  VERY POOR followup care.  He cares about getting the surgery and then he is DONE.  VERY nice offices and it shows by how much he is raking in by doing surgeries, requesting followup visits in which he barely spends a couple of minutes and moves onto the next patient that can make him some money.  I used to work for 3 surgeons and was impressed at first and appalled by his lack of response when I had a post op infection.  He also misrepresented the healing time and results.  I would NEVER go to this doctor again or recommend him to anyone.  He was completely negligent when it came to returning calls when I had a fever after returning home (in which they tell you to call immediately) and when I went to the nearest hospital, that then sent me to another since he wouldn't get back to me.  I was an inpatient for several days with NO visit/call or input from Dr. Gersoff.  Would you want to go to this doctor?  I hope not.\", \"I recently visited this Family Medical Center and met one of the rudest nurses I have ever met in my life. When we set up the appointment at this clinic, we were told that they wanted to set our appointment up for the following week since they were going to get my records from another Winter Haven Hospital clinic prior to my appointment. This apparently did not happen. While I was there, the nurse acted like I was such an inconvenience for her. From her huffing and puffing about how I should have gotten my medical records to the nastiness in her tone when she asked her screening questions, I quickly figured out that this was the wrong establishment for me to be seeking medical treatment. I informed her that she was one of the rudest people I had ever met and that I was leaving. I called back to the office to ask that the desk let Dr. Torres know that I was sorry for wasting his time but I was not going to tolerate being treated rudely by this nurse. The lady on the phone did not offer any apology or attempt to resolve the issue. At this point, I informed her I would be filing a complaint with Winter Haven Hospital in hopes that they will reeducate this nurse as to what patient service actually is. The Doctor could have been one of the best in the industry but I will never know. When I look at the fact that I was told one thing about my records, then treated like an inconvenience because they didn't have them, clearly this indicates that this office doesn't know what it is doing. When you couple that with the lack of customer service skills, I have to wonder what these people are doing in the healthcare industry. I am glad there are other options out there for healthcare and I would strongly recommend that you pursue those options before coming to Lake Wales Family Medical Center on 201 State Road 60 W, Lake Wales, FL 33853.\", 'I am very disappointed in this office. I searched several places to get laser hair removal and a tattoo removed. I chose this office because they did both and thought I would be happy with the results after going in for my consultation. Little did I know I was in for a ride. I was first told that my laser hair removal would take about 10 sessions and my tattoo at least 5. I realize that they were not able to tell me the exact number it would take but now that I have spent A LOT of money I feel like they were just sucking me in little by little. I was told that after 5 treatments on my tattoo that I would be very satisfied. It is not even half way faded. When I ask Dr White if she would be satisfied with the results after 5 visits of the tattoo removal her answer to me was \"oh, you wanted it completely removed.\" Well thats what I came for right TATTOO REMOVAL!! When I paid for my first package I was told that the laser hair removal would take 10 visits and the tattoo removal 5 visits. Thats all that was said. So when I paid I assumed I was paying for 10 sessions and 5 sessions. Well after my tattoo removal package ran out, I was told that I only paid for 5 visits for both. It was very very misleading. During each session I was asked how happy I was and all along I had said well for the tattoo, I am going to need to see a lot of change since I only have a few more sessions but as for the hair removal I have at least 5 or 6, 6 or 7 (what ever the case may have been) left. They never said anything about me only having 1 or 2 left. The whole thing was a BIG let down. Please, please reconsider if you are thinking about having anything done here. The office staff was nice but everytime I went I always had to wait forever and there was always some kind of problem going on!! Pros: The only reason they got one star is because I had to. Cons: NOT Straight forward', 'I have been seeing Dr. Harden since 1996. I stopped seeing her in the early 2000s for a few years, due to moving to another city. I came back to San Antonio a few years ago and chose to continue to see her for my annual visits. Seeing a gynecologist is a difficult issue for me. It seems that I\\'ve had a few scares which turned out to be fine however, they were still \"scares.\" Add to that, I am a private person and insecure by the whole visit in the first place. Dr. Harden seemed to be a good person in the 90s. She was kind, positive, and took her time. I still remember after my first visit with her, she sent me a hand written note stating \"it was nice meeting you.\" When I came back in early 2000, she had changed. During the years I did not see Dr. Harden, I had 2 children, was going through major depression, and had gained a significant amount of weight. When saw me again, she noticed I was on an antidepressant. She said \"maybe you just need to see a good therapist and exercise.\" I was floored and began tearing up. I didn\\'t say anything. I was shocked and felt so judged. Little did she know that I was in therapy. Regardless, who is she to judge someone for taking an antidepressant? After that visit, I decided to continue to see her the following year. Yes, this is where I went wrong. The following year, I was still up in weight and she made a point to mention it to me and not in a kind manner I might add. The office has a weight loss program so I know that is an extra money-maker. I realize that I need to be healthier however, when one is overweight they know this is a fact. When someone is overweight perhaps they are struggling with past abuse and food issues? Perhaps a lot has happened in their life and they are indeed working on it. Apparently, Dr. Harden does not see patients who are living in the real world. See this doctor if you are a perfect size, with the perfect life, and no problems otherwise, be ready for judgement. I do have to say that she comes across as an analytic who practices medicine aggressively. I believe she has an anxious, perfectionistic side where she is careful not to make mistakes in medicine. Again, this would have to be an asset as a doctor. If only she could have the compassion necessary, that would make her a true doctor.', \"I have had ongoing knee pricked since 2009. Every other doctor I went to simply wrote it off as runners knee from over use since I ran half marathons. I went through 3 rounds of therapy, took a year off from running and had an MRI done but my results showed nothing wrong. I knew that being 19 pain with every step isn't normal but no doctor took the time to care or understand running is my passion. I eventually found dr leek and what a miracle. I had surgery done and he found 3 problems with my knee and fixed them. I will start running in about another 5 weeks so I am keeping my fingers crossed it worked. But just after a week from surgery I can tell an improvement. Walking is less painful now than before surgery. And you would think tha only after a week my pain would still be high. I am willing to say that if I had a different doctor I would probably be in yet another round of therapy because they didn't take the time to listen closely enough to me. Dr Leek didn't see anything on the MRI but that didn't keep him from trying surgery. I suppose intuition a gift some doctors just dont have, or maybe none of them care about anything than their high paying salaries, but dr leek in my opinion has everything all the other doctors who failed me didn't. As I said I'm still keeping myFingers crossed about running in the future but if I keep recovering at this rate and stray away from pot holes to twist my knee in, I can say this man gave me my life back.\", 'Dr. Hale\\'s office person who makes the appointments said, \"He won\\'t see you unless you\\'ve exhausted all your options.\" I thought that meant that he was an expert in high demand, not what I later found out myself, and from others, that he is a surgery-happy doctor, and that that\\'s the only thing he advises for everyone, and tries to scare people into doing. He saw me for limited symptoms caused by calcium buildup on the vertebrae, (OPLL), and the resulting spinal cord compression. At the time I had no idea what was going on, and he told me I could become quadriplegic from even sneezing, or tripping and falling, and needed to get immediate fusion surgery. I spent 6 anxiety-ridden weeks, researching the condition, while waiting for a Flagstaff neurosurgeon, Dr. David Sacco\\'s second opinion. I discovered that there is absolutely NO empirical evidence of any kind that someone who has my condition is at greater risk of quadriplegia, and that it is only general, commonly held \"common sense wisdom\" by doctors. The second opinion was to simply keep an eye on the condition, and get another MRI in 6 months to a year, as my symptoms were minimal, and had already gone mostly away after making lifestyle changes, in terms of getting up from sitting regularly, and doing stretches. Doctor Hale and his assistant would not call me back to discuss any of this, even after I called back twice, both times being assured that he would call me. This doctor is really hurting people by creating huge anxiety, that only makes healing much more difficult. He is both unethical and unconscionable in his greedy pursuit of endless $21k operations. He covers himself from liability and sanctions, by using surgery scare tactics in person, like saying that you could become quadriplegic from even sneezing, or tripping and falling if you don\\'t get surgery, but then in the actual written report, only saying that the risk of injury was only \"relatively greater!', 'My opinion is completely opposite from a few years ago. He\\'s great UNTIL you really need help. After TEN YEARS of never missing an appointment and being WAY too honest with him, I asked him to contact a new pain doctor who refused to treat me with opiates because I admitted I had smoked marijuana in the past. I was years past any substance abuse problems and opiates were not what I abused. I had already been on hydrocodone for several years, but fired the doctor who was prescribing it. I made numerous attempts, but Pandya refused to speak to me on the phone. At my next appointment, I took my sister in with me. She was also his patient, nearly as long as I. I asked him why he refused to write the note I needed since I told him *everything* about my past substance issues. He said it was just that we had not discussed it in a long time. True, because there was nothing to discuss. I was sober. The reason I took my sister in with me was to have a witness to my attitude and demeanor. She said I did not seem angry or upset, I spoke in a calm, reasonable voice, and it was clear I only wanted an answer to a question. I made no more requests for the note, dropped the subject and continued as usual with the appointment. Before our next appointments, we both got letters saying he was dropping us because he could \"not provide the level of care required\". What? Suddenly, after a decade we were BOTH too loony for him to keep seeing? What does that say about the 10 years of treatment from HIM? I guess he made us worse. And couldn\\'t even tell us to our faces he was dropping us. Lots of his former patients have said he is a coward and they are right. The pain doctor who wanted the note, upon being told that I had been seeing Pandya for 10 years, told me that they are very good friends. My sister had been seeing that same pain doctor for 10 years and he\\'s a very strict one. Considering my absolute honesty (e.g. telling that I slipped and went on another crack binge), and his own ILLEGAL practices such as prescribing Ritalin to a former stimulant abuser AND giving me 3 prescriptions for it at the same time, dated one month apart. NOT legal on Schedule II meds! He also created some false paperwork so I could get therapy my insurance didn\\'t pay for so it seemed like I was seeing him. I appreciated it, but I think that was probably Medicare fraud. I think he was just afraid I\\'d be just as honest with his good friend and spill his dirty secrets. None of this was bad at all compared to what he did to my adult daughter. She was also his patient for a shorter time. She told him she had had problems with benzodiazapines (Valium, Xanax, Klonopin, etc.) He prescribed her some anyway. She told me she intended to ask him to double her dosage, so I reminded him of her issues with such meds and asked him not to give her more than she was getting. He agreed not to, but did it anyway. About 6 months later, she overdosed (NOT by accident) on the tranquilizers he prescribed along with some oxycontin and alcohol. She was in the hospital for 5 days. Upon her release, he gave her new prescriptions for more Klonopin AND oxycontin! He had no business giving her pain meds at all. She was already getting too many from another doctor. But WHAT was he thinking giving her the very same things she overdosed on? That\\'s seriously messed up. Luckily, she went straight to inpatient rehab and dumped this quack. He could have killed her! His long-time receptionist Louise is always a pleasure to chat with. She is such a sweetie, but also incredibly efficient. Kudos to her for keeping the office running smoothly! I just hope my long-time opinion and former 5-star review didn\\'t cause anyone to see him and end up suffering for it! Live and learn, I guess.', 'Dr. Lawton had me suffer with a fibroid that grew for eight months. I bled everyday and every time I called her to tell her about it she said it was normal!! Her diagnosis was for me to have a hysterectomy. Early on when I first went to her she did a balloon ablation but the fibroid did not come out at that point. It wasn\\'t until the eighth month that my body tried to expel it. The fibroid began to crown and I bled profusely. She had me go to her office where she stuck her hand up my uterus and attempted to yank, yes yank it out. No anesthetic, no hospital room, just a room in her office. When it would not come out she told me I needed a hysterectomy. I did not agree, so she requested a scapel from her nurse and she literally cut it from the thread that was holding it, more blood. Dr. Lawton then dropped the fibroid in a beaker (I could still recognize that sound) and showed it to me. When she walked out of the office her nurse said, \"I can\\'t believe she did that!\" She then walked back in the room and told the nurse to give me a pad and off I went. Unbelievable! Too bad I did not go for a second opinion until after the fibroid was out. The second gynecologist told me that doctors make their money by giving hysterectomies and I believe that is what Dr. Lawton wanted to do. He said he would testify in court on my behalf if needed. I felt from day one that she and her staff liked certain patients and I was not one of them. It has been many years since this traumatic event that I will never forget and I just want everyone to know I still have all of my parts, thank the good Lord.', 'This is a follow-up review four years post-surgery. The hip prosthesis implanted by Dr. Kavanaugh was recalled, requiring removal. I got a generic \"dear patient\" letter from his office notifying me of this, with zero follow-up from them to make certain I had received the letter. (A friend of mine, with the same implant but different surgeon, got a personal phone call from the surgeon himself regarding the recall. ) After my previous experience with Dr. Kavanaugh, I was not inclined to see him again. I found another surgeon to do the revision surgery, and this doctor immediately identified the reason that the original implant had never worked well for me: the acetabular cup had been put in incorrectly. This was confirmed by another doctor during a separate visit. (Dr. Kavanaugh always acted as if I were making things up when I said my leg motion was off.) The experience with the second surgeon just served to reinforce how poor my experience with Dr. Kavanaugh was - from the lack of communication, to the poor technique of the surgery, to the haphazard way my incision was closed. I have warned several people away from using Dr. Kavanaugh and will continue to do so.', 'I was recently treated by Dr. Blasko at Riverside Emergency. I did not have a good experience with her at all. 2 weeks ago my Obgyn told me my 7 week old baby did not have a heartbeat and I had to take Misoprostol for the miscarriage to take affect. After a week and a half of emotional and physical pain, my body started bleeding something aweful and I needed to go to the emergency room. She came in to \"treat\" me and I must say, I have never been judged by anyone so harshly in my life. She treated me as if I had a choice in the matter, as if I did this to myself, willingly. She was so rough with me and hurt me very badly when removing blood clots. And after the entire horrid experience she yelled at the nurse that she had no idea \"this was the kind of case she was dealing with\". As if I had not been through enough, she scarred me for life with her thoughtlessness and her treatment. It was the most horrible thing I have ever had to go through in my life. I would not reccomend her.', 'Horrible place! Horrible! I have alot to say about this place, mostly about my experience there and how it left me traumatized and in pain. I still get sick to my stomach when I think about my experiences there. I have been going here for the last 11 years. I started when I was 16yo, on my mom\\'s HMO plan. When I was a teenager I went to see Dr. Stasiewicz about a sensitive issue that I didn\\'t want my family to find out about so naturally I was a little anxious. I asked him for an STD screening. He seemed uncomfortable that I was gay, and ended up telling me I had to see a therapist before he would administer any healthcare. Shrug... I didn\\'t know you had to get your mental competency signed off on to get an STD screening. As if I imagined becoming sexually active, and my concerns were illegitimate. There was no compassion in the way he talked to me, treated me, or turned me away, and I feel disgusted to this day about how a doctor ever made me feel that way. I didn\\'t like the doctors office anymore, and I tried not to go back until I was 22 and had an unbearable pain in my abdomen, just this crippling pain. I chose to see another doctor, Dr. Kim, who diagnosed me with some colon disease that apparently occurs in old men, basically he didn\\'t know what he was doing. He did absolutely no tests other than pressing down on my abdomen. For a whole month I was in devastating pain, went in and out of there. Finally Dr Kim gets his supervisor involved, who within 5min of looking at me figured out I had kidney stones. I change my doctor to Dr Biorkman who never gave me the time of day. He would sit down with me for no more than 2 min, and no more than answering/asking 1 question about 1 thing would he then get up and walk out, saying he will be right back. Be right back means be right back, right? To Dr. Biorkman it was his way of ending the appointment, as his nurse would come in and send me home.  I got kidney stones again, and he wouldn\\'t hear it. I decided to just pay the high copay and go to the ER. Infact, I started going to the ER from that point on. Those doctors were absolutely useless! Kidney stones occurred 2 more times after that from age 22-25. I went to Biorkman one last time for a referral to a urologist. He gave me a prescription pad signed \"Referral for urologist\" signed Biorkman. I laughed out loud, who was I supposed to give this piece of paper to? Or was he just giving me his autograph? He did not know how to submit a referral to my insurance nor did he have his nurse bother with finding out. Aside from the big stuff, whenever I asked about vaccinations, diabetes screening, or my options for quit smoking aids, not one doctor EVER discussed those issues. They change the subject and pretended like I never asked in the first place. I don\\'t think they ever knew at any point in 11 years where my health stood in terms of glucose and cholesterol as they never ever ever ever ran a check up out of the many times I was in there and I have the medical records to prove it. For 11 years I thought this was what health care was, until I finally sought out a new doctor. I found a doctor who was independent from any medical groups. She knew how to submit a referral to a Urologist, I didn\\'t have to ask her before she ran blood work to check my glucose and cholesterol levels. To me she is the greatest doctor in the world, but in reality shes just how any other doctor should be. Bristol Park? Did these doctors even go to medical school? They seem more concerned about policy and cost than keeping you healthy. Don\\'t trust this group with your family.', \"comments I actually was Dr. Bourn's first patient,when the clinic literally just opened. Furniture was actually being moved in,lol. I was able to refer myself oddly enough and I did not need a Doctor referral. But Dr.Bourn seemed very caring and genuine and remained to be for about 7 months. Everything came to a halt when I was unable to complete the physical therapy regimen. This was due to acute anxiety I have suffered from for 15 years. All of this documented and diagnosed by a Psychiatrist,although those facts alone meant nothing to Dr. Bourn,he seemed annoyed and I could tell he did not think I was being genuine. Although I was. That day I was dismissed. I have heard that he has gotten much worse as far as his bedside manner from reading these reviews. Again,another Doctor that is not willing to bend over backwards for there patients. What an enigma. I would not reccommend Dr. Bourn upon reading the majority of these reviews.\", 'Mary Fisher has been the worst OB I have ever had! I had an absolute horrible experience with her while she was my OB, I am grateful I moved and found a wonderful OB who delivered both of my completely healthy children. Fisher, failed to return pages when I called her after hours line, she completely lacked bedside manners, and on my last visit before my move, she informed me that my pap test, which I had done months before, had come back abnormal and she was sorry that she failed to call me to let me know. So I was entering my second trimester, already stressed out about moving while pregnant, and now she dumped that bomb on me right before I moved and had to search for a new OB! I left her office in tears on two occasions, once because she straight out called me \"fat\" and said that I was likely to have gestational diabetes. However, when I moved and went to a different OB, he said my weight gain was right on track and I had no complications during my pregnancy what so ever! On a different visit, my husband asked her when we would have an ultra sound done, she responded that it wouldn\\'t be till I was 20 weeks. My husband was disappointed (he really wanted to see the baby) and asked why our friends, who lived in a different state got to have ultrasounds done on every visit. Mary Fisher basically ripped into my husband, saying that we should be grateful we even get an ultrasound done, and went into a tangent on the politics of the unfairness of insurance companies. I understand that not everyone has the same coverage, but when I moved I discovered that some OB\\' s own their own ultrasound machines and include it as part of the check up. I guess it different in Florida than it is in California. Bottom line, Fisher was just awful! I would never recommend her to anyone,she was unprofessional, unkind, and negligent. Stay away!', 'A doctor is suppose to help you, not make you worse. I\\'ve been to many therapists over the years and this is by far THE WORST therapist I\\'ve ever met. I\\'ve been going to Dr. Wang for 8 months now. The first appointment was with a counselor (who I though was very nice and attentive) and Dr. Wang came up for the last 5 minutes and diagnosed me with ADHD. From the first time I talked to her it was clear that she had a very strong bias against ADHD and the stimulants that are traditionally used to treat it. She wanted to to start on a different medication that is not usually used and I agreed. After months of trying different medications, all which did not help, she started me on stimulants. The medication helped a lot but I began to feel very uncomfortable by the way she began speaking to me. As soon as I started the treatment that she was reluctant to start, she started speaking to me in a very judgmental and rude way. She even told me I suffered from Depression after I told her that I had been depressed before and I am positive I am no longer depressed. She put me on antidepressants any way and refused to take me off even if I told her it wasn\\'t doing anything and I didn\\'t want to be on unnecessary medication. Many times she told me that I \"wasn\\'t capable\" of accomplishing things other students were even though I am a very good student and have never failed a course. I started to notice that I started to feel worse and worse after every meeting. She made me start to question my own abilities for the first time and I began to feel depressed again for the first time after being completely healthy for two years. I didn\\'t feel comfortable talking to her about the problems I began to have because she was so judgmental. Also, she refuses to talk to you on the phone. Even if you have a simple question or paperwork that can be faxed to her, she makes you make an appointment. I had to wait at least 5-15 minutes for every appointment and she only spoke to me for 10 minutes before she rushed me out. I stayed only because she was on my insurance plan and the location was convenient. By the last visit she became completely unprofessional. She couldn\\'t find my file so we started the session without it. After a few minutes, it was clear that she had very little clue about who I was. She made all of theses false statements about me and when I corrected her she told me I was arguing with her. (she said i wasn\\'t sleeping enough and I had to remind her that we had discussed 7-8 hours of sleep, which I was getting.) She refused to listen to me and let me say very little. She clumped me in her other patients saying they were abusing their medication and that I would too. She made rash accusations saying I had dyslexia, a learning disability, and an anxiety problem whenever I proved her statements about me incorrect. She had no basis for her rash claims and it was very unprofessional. By the end it felt like she was purposely patronizing me to make me leave. I am never going to her again and I suggest that no one else wastes their time and money. She doesn\\'t treat you as an individual patient and clumps you in with all of her other patients with the same diagnosis. She\\'s obviously had some negative experiences with ADHD patients but it\\'s completely unacceptable that she let that influence the way she treated me even when she couldn\\'t remember anything about me or my case. From the moment I started stimulants she categorized me as a drug abuser and made no efforts to hide her personal beliefs. Unprofessional and Rude. Absolutely disgusted that she calls herself a doctor.', 'I am a first time soon to be mom. At my almost 30 weeks of pregnancy I have only seen \"my doctor\" for about 5 seconds. I dread everytime I have an appointment because I know it is going to be a long wait and I am only going to be seen for about 2 minutes by a physician (whos not even Dr. Marimon) To me, thats not enough time to ask any questions or make light of any concerns. They never ask anyway either. I went with this doctor because it was the first one apointed by my insurance and I had already made the decision to give birth at Kendall Regional because every other hospital seems too far away. I also read all they amazing reviews in several websites but after speaking to a couple of his patients who have the same experience as me I decided to write my own. I cant say if he is a good doctor or not, because I havent even spent time with him. I just keep hoping and praying that the day my baby decides to come nothing goes wrong and everything goes smoothly. I think this doctor takes on way too many patients, I usually have my appointments scheduled for 9AM because I have work and dont like to miss too much of the day, but even if I get to the office at 8.30 the waiting room is already PACKED with women. I dont understand that. Do they just give EVERYONE the same time? I really thought this experience was going to be different, I thought this being a CHILD that is going to be born soon I would feel that I had more support from a doctor. Honestly, i get more answers from google. I feel like im just going through the system and I hate it. If I ever decided to have another child I will definitely be going a different way and hope not to have such a bad experience. I wont even comment on the staff... They always seem to be ovewhelmed and too distracted to help. Which I guess is understandable since there are so many other ppl they have to attend to. Its just overall not a pleasant experience if you were expecting more hands on care.', 'Four stars in the vitals.com system are not enough. Gary Alweiss is a perfect 10 on my measuring scale. Take a minute please to hear the details. I came to Gary Alweiss after four other doctors from various specialties had failed to diagnose a condition that caused excruciating pain which lasted for ten straight days and sleepless nights. First I wanted the physical pain to end, and then I wanted to know what was going on inside my body. Having gone through previous blood tests, multiple MRIs, and several hospital visits, I was bothered by as much psychic pain from a lack of knowledge as I was by obvious muscle atrophy and nerve pain. After a thorough neurological workup, this superb doctor told me with total confidence (and correctness): \"You have diabetic amyotrophy. About 1% of all diabetic patients experience these symptoms you have been having. The pain does goes away and repeat attacks are even rarer. In time, with physical rehabilitation you are going to be back to your normal self. Your muscles will get stronger and the peripheral nerves will regenerate.\" I came out of that office feeling that Gary Alweiss had restored first my sense of mental health, and secondarily he was going to guide me back to full bodily health. And that\\'s exactly what happened. His extraordinary diagnostic, his comforting manner and his overall medical expertise were a godsend to me and my family. This note on vitals.com is my way of trying to say a proper thank you to this superb physician and to let any neurologic patient in the Englewood area of Northern New Jersey know that help can be on the way ---------- by scheduling an appointment to see Dr. Gary Alweiss.', \"I went to Dr davis because she delivered my last daughter and I was pregnant again. Repeatedly she had to cancel and reschedule and I was very understanding. I waited in the office for 2.5 hours before someone told me she wouldn't be able to see me, I just rescheduled, even though my husband took time off to bring me in. However, if I was late or even missed an appointment because I was told the WRONG time on the phone after they rescheduled again, she decided to drop me. This was halfway through my pregnancy. So I feel obligated to state that I went to l&d bleeding (at 23 weeks) and she never showed up to check on me. No one from her office came over. And they didn't do the simplest procedure that is commonplace and might have put my unborn child at risk. So I'm happy to find another doctor. I'm afraid I'd go in labor and she would miss that too. If you need attention from your OB or even for THEM to keep an appointment this is definitely not the place for you.\", \"Run, do not walk, away from this doctor. He is perhaps the most incompetent doctor we have ever run across. We were referred to him by the Georgia Crisis and Access line because my son was in crisis. He needed medication management. To begin with, Dr. Richardson was rude and condescending to us. Beyond that, he has absolutely no grasp on medications that are used to manage psychiatric conditions. He was using some small book to look up dosages and various medications. That did not make us feel very confident. Then, he made 2 changes to my son's routine at the same time. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that THAT wasn't a smart thing to do. Because then, we didn't know if it was decreasing the first medication or adding the second which, again, he did simultaneously.Following this change, my son ended up in a crisis home and Dr. Richardson has YET to return our call. My son was in the home for 4 days. What if he had been in the hospital? To be a doctor and be that unreachable is inexcusable and bordering on malpractice in my opinion.He seems to hate his job at the Mental Health Comprehensive Services Center. Again, RUN away from him or cancel your appointment if you have one. There are better options out there.\", \"I originally met doctor Tuttlemen in the emergency room. I had terrible pain, and the doctors there called him because they wanted a gynecology expert to help them. He found my problem, and rushed me in to emergency surgery. It was a Sunday evening, and he controlled a surgery robot to take out a huge growth they found. I went to see him and his staff at his office a few days later to go over the results from the surgery and to look at my belly. I was walking the morning after surgery, left the hospital later that night, and never had any real pain. I had some discomfortable feeling in my belly, but little tiny holes he used. Anyway, when I went to his office, the results were the worst possible news. The growth they took out was a cancerous tumor. He called my primary doctor, his nurse practitioner Rich sat with me and explained everything to me again. They both gave me lots of time to answer all of my questions. They answered my sisters questions on the phone when I had he call back. He called my doctor right in the room with me, they got other doctors to help me with the cancer, and I have been cancer free for 8 years now. I had been to the emergency room previously that month, they gave me pain medication and medication because I was throwing up, then they sent me home. This may sound a little strong, but I thank Ron Tuttlemen for saving my life. My sister and daughter go to him. If you have seen other doctors, and they don't know how to help you, or can't find what is wrong with you, I can tell you first hand, I would send you to him, and fast. My daughter is going to have her first baby, he will delvier it, and I will be there. I am alive and able to be there because of him. Thank you to him and his workers who I have gotten to know, and they know my family. They are like family.\", 'I was admitted to North Central Baptist on May 9, 2014 and stayed for 16 days after major surgery. I was readmitted on August 29 for a second surgery. My surgeon said I would be in the hospital for 7-10 days this time. The care took a nightmarish turn for the worse. In an effort to draw my blood, a parade of three nurses stuck me a total of 8 times without success. I waited another hour before a phlebotomist came in and took my blood without a problem. After surgery, I requested adoctor to look at my spiking blood pressure (I have always had perfect BP). For 5 hours I was assured that the doctor was on the way and to be patient. When the shift changed the new nurse said that no doctor had been called. She did not know what I was talking about. She said I would have to wait until the hospitalist made normal rounds. I waited a total of 7 hours to see a doctor after my request. I dealt with snarky nurses and belligerent staff, and I went without any care or visits from staff for up to 8 hours at a time (no vitals were taken - I did not even see a housekeeper). After I was left in my room for 8 hours without anyone entering I finally got a visit from the kid who takes vitals. I asked him if he wasn\\'t supposed to take vitals every four hours and he said \"that is what your call button is for\". I asked him if vitals were now only taken on patient request? He refused to answer me and would no longer respond at all. He turned his back on me as if I wasn\\'t in the room. Some of the staff are worse than others, but the pattern of covering up for others is evident. When I finally saw a doctor on regular rounds (7 hours after my request), the treatment was to give me morphine to shut me up even though I argued against it. After all, a drugged patient is a compliant patient. My blood pressure remained very high and no treatment was provided for its cause. Lastly, due to colon surgery I am supposed to eat and process regular food before being discharged. I told the hospitalist that I had nothing to eat or drink for 48 hours and have not had solid food for over a week as I had no appetite. Her answer? - more morphine. After informing my surgeon of the above issues we both concluded that North Central Baptist was not a conducive environment to healing. He discharged me days ahead of plan so that I could heal at home. I wrote an email of complaint to the hospital president, Bill Waechter. Two weeks later I got a response from a low level staffer basically blowing me off. After this, I have justifiably concluded that patient care is way down on the priority list at North Central Baptist, if it is on their list at all.', 'My dad was referred to Dr. Firstenberg for a lung mass. On his first visit, he brought with him his prior records including a biopsy report of a prior melanoma. Dr. Firstenberg ordered a lung biopsy. The results were inconclusive, stating it could be lung cancer,but melanoma could not be ruled out. Rather than doing due diligence as a physician and ordering another biopsy, he proceeded with chemo for lung cancer with older,lesser used drugs that cause greater side effects and gave my dad terrible peripheral neuropathy pain until the day he died of melanoma 6 months later at UT Southwestern Hospital. He was treated for the WRONG CANCER for 3 months before going toUT Southstern Hospital when the cancer had spread even more,they did another biopsy and confirmed it was melanoma. He never had lung cancer. Be very careful before choosing an oncologist. My dad told my before he died he was discouraged multiple times by Dr. Firstenberg from getting a second opinion. ', 'After reading some other comments, I felt compeled to rate Dr. Overn as well. I have had similar experiences as other patients in that he has prescribed me anti-depresants and anxiety medications when seeking help for different ailments. My wife is in the medical field and is a good source of information. After referring to my wife a couple of times regarding some information she had given me, Dr. Overn asked me if I wanted to be treatede by my wife or him. I stared him down for a few seconds and had to bite my tongue to keep from knocking his block off. His office has been slow to respond and even unresponsive to insurance requests for prescription approvals. I have gone to him on and off for the last few years, but will never go again.', 'I cannot say enough wonderful things about Dr. Mackoul and the staff at the Center for Innovative GYN Care. I had a very large, pedunculated fibroid (11 cm) located on the outside of my uterus. The fi broid started out small when first diagnosed years ago and my then OB/GYN suggested watchful waiting. While I had no pain or bleeding with this type of fibroid, I did, however, over this past year, notice that I was having some symptoms that included bloating, the appearance of a lump when laying down, and frequent urination. I heard about Dr. Mackoul while listening to WTOP on the way to work one morning. I contacted the Center and was able to get a consult appointment at the Annapolis office. Because I am 47 years old, and do not plan to have children, a hysterectomy was recommended, but leaving my one ovary. I was very nervous, but Dr. Mackoul was very reassuring and explained to me everything I needed to know. I had surgery at Holy Cross Hospital on 2/16/16. I came home that evening, took a pain pill to help me sleep that night. When I woke up the next morning, I couldnt believe how good I felt. I only used Motrin for the next two days and returned to work six days later on 2/22/16. You cant even tell where my incisions were! All I can say is my experience from beginning to end has been top notch. For women that are told they need invasive surgery, you MUST make an appointment with Dr. Mackoul. You will not regret it. He is amazing.', \"My dad was referred to Dr. Firstenberg for a lung mass. On his first visit, my dad brought records of his prior melanoma, including a prior biopsy. Dr. Firstenberg ordered a biopsy of the lung mass, it was inconclusive, stating it could be lung cancer, but could not rule out melanoma. He did not do his due diligence as a physician and oncologist and order another biopsy, rather he decided to move forward with the diagnosis of lung cancer. Months later after my dad's cancer worsened on treatment with older, lesser used chemo drugs (which caused chemo-induced peripheral neuropathy until the day he died), he was referred to UT Southwestern Hospital for another biopsy on additional metastasis, which confirmed he had melanoma, NOT LUNG CANCER. So months were wasted treating the wrong cancer, he was poisoned with the wrong chemo drugs, all while the cancer multiplied in his body. The chemo-induced peripheral neuropathy made him too weak to start treatment for the melanoma. He died 6 months after the diagnosis of the lung mass. He told me before he died that on multiple occasions he asked Dr. Firstenberg if he should get a second opinion regarding his cancer and treatment and each time he was discouraged from doing so. He trusted his doctor and this likely shortened his life.\", 'I was treated by Dr. McLemore for anal hpv. She inflicted more pain on me than I thought was possible. She gave me unrealistic estimates of healing time. (The surgery took me over 2 months to heal from.) I personally found McLemore to be emotionally cold, overly defensive, and sometimes impatient. My non-expert assessment of my surgical case is that she cut me up more than she should have but that she did this because she wanted to be thorough. If I had it to do over again I would find a different surgeon or try to put more limits on what I let McLemore do to me. On the other hand she was very thorough, she did not scar me up too bad, she was available when I needed her, and my physical health was never in danger.', 'I was around 23 when i went to go see Dr. Franco. I had been dealing with TMJ issues since i was 19. I had undergone two arthroscopy surgeries previously that did not work and my jaw had started to degenerate. Dr. Franco stated that I would need to have surgery. I come from a family where we never had health insurance nor did we see the Dr. So i was going into this all alone, under my own insurance and still relatively young. All the reviews i read about TMJ surgery where it was invasive suggested that it did not help with pain alleviation. So during a consultation with this almost 40 year old man (he had to be around 40) i naturally asked a lot of questions. If you;re about to undergo a surgery requiring massive jaw replacement through a very evasive procedure and lots of rehabilitation, i would assume anyone would want to know what the success factors are, how many patients he had, how comfortable he felt that it would help, etc. Well he was very very annoyed with the fact that I would dare ask him questions. After our meeting, he proceeded to send me, a person at least 20 years his junior, still in undergrad a very, very nasty letter, I wish i would have kept it to post it here. His letter basically stated that he did not want to render his services to me because i questioned him and he didnt see it as a healthy patient dr relationship. I was so upset by his letter, granted i had done all this research myself and I was doing this all alone, that I never seeked any other help for my tmj issues, fearing that i would receive the same treatment with other doctors. I am now 32 and a lot wiser. Also, my jaw is severely worse. I basically have a big empty mass for my lower jaw. I am more confident now and willing to seek help, too bad it was to the detriment of my health. I would definitely, definitely recommend and plead that everyone stay away from this doctor. He is mean and, as i experience, can end up hurting you more than helping you.', 'This location deserves higher reviews. I received very nice service from the nurses after going through hell at the Oceanside location. These nurses were very sweet to me from the moment I came in. I always get very nervous when I go to the hospital so it always nice that they were so talkative and personalable, making me feel more comfortable. The hell I went through at Oceanside, feel free to read that review as well, caused issues here as well because they gave me wrong date for my Depo shot. I was 4 days late for it. I was almost in tears when I explained the hell I went through at the Oceanside location after coming in late, and now it was their fault, so they took pity on my situation. The nurses talked it over and, being that I had been on Depo for over 2 years (and it was only 4 days late) I did a urine pregnancy test that they actually tested on the spot instead of making me come back even LATER like Oceanside did. I tested negative and she asked me if I would like to lay down, which I gladly did. I barley felt the shot, no big deal, and I was on my way. I will be going back this weekend for my next shot. I hope I get a nurse that is just as cool as the one I had last time. It was a good experience.', 'I went to see Dr. John Washburn, for a severe sore throat, headache (migraine), ears hurting intensely. I had a fever the night before of 101.5. Anyway, the nurse asks my pain level from 1 to 10 and I say a 10. I was ready to cry I hurt so bad. Dr.Washburn says I will give you an antibiotic because it could be strep. I will also give you acetaminophen 600 mg. I started to cry because I knew my pain level and that was not going to help. So he actually said to me, (a 60 year old retired Kindergarten Teacher of 30 years), \"So, Nancy, you\\'re telling me you want narcotics?\" This doctor was terribly rude and ?\" And I said, \"Of course!\" Still, no bedside manner and no understanding whatsoever. He did finally give me 5 mg. of hydrocodone. I am sure people come in just looking for narcotics as he put it but I never have. I will never go back to him again. I would so say he is the worst doctor I have ever been to! Several months ago, I called him because I had a stomach bug. I was having diarrhea and vomiting at the same time. I couldn\\'t keep a sip of water down. The receptionist informed me I would have to come in. I told her I could not even leave the bathroom and I just wanted something for nausea. I was taking Imodium but it was not working. She said sorry, he can\\'t give you any medication unless you come in! Again, so rude and uncaring. I don\\'t want anyone else to have to pick a doctor that could care less about your feelings! I have a handful of wonderful doctors, I think my gynecologist would have probably seen me for strep and he is amazing. I will ask one of my other doctors for a referral for a general practitioner. If you know a good one, please let me know!', \"Dr. Horberg is the worst kind of doctor. He seems all friendly and enthusiastic when you first meet him, but beware - he has a huge ego, he does NOT listen, he has zero patience, and I'm not sure he knows what he is doing. If I shared the details of my story involving Dr. Horberg, it would make your hair stand on end. He terribly misdiagnosed me and was IRRITATED when I continued to see him as my health declined. I finally begged him to admit me to a hospitaI, which he reluctantly did. However, when he called ahead to the hospital to let them know I was coming, he told them I was have a nervous breakdown! Finally it was the ER doc who recognized how sick I was. I was hospitalized for three weeks and missed two months of work. Horberg never apologized and insisted until the end that he did not misdiagnose me. Nice guy.\", 'Dr. Mirando was quite possibly the worst doctor I have ever been to. He spent a total of two minutes in the room, did not listen to what I had to say, and interrupted me while I was trying to explain what was wrong, and then gave a smart remark. He at first basically said there were no options for my issue then after he basically ran out of the room the nurse could see I was upset and told him to come back in. He then offered several other options he had for whatever reason not offered before. He then tried to act concerned and he was basically talking in circles and nothing was resolved. He was also very rude to the nurse as she was writing the prescriptions. I feel sorry for the nurses who have to work with someone like that. I will never go back to him again. He made me feel insignificant and as if I was bothering him by being there. However, the nurse, Debbie, was extremely nice and she told me when she would be in the office if I needed to call with questions because she could tell there was no way I would be calling to ask him anything. I will definitely be going to Dr. Guido next time.', \"I thought Dr. Richey would be great at first, but on my first visit when I told him I was having issues of relaxing after work and sleeping issues because of my job, he told me to quit my job as the answer instead of finding a cure or treatment, I should have stopped then but I didn't. I have always had strep issues and rheumatic fever prior to seeing him, and when I contacted him about a possible strep was there a way I could come in, he treated me with antibiotics, but then the issue resurfaced 4 days later, when I called in to talk about my concerns the staff said he would be get back to me shortly, 5 hours later he finally returns my call and can't see me for 2 more days. He saw me and sent me to a specialists because it was so bad. A sick patient is important and should be dealt with urgently not 5 hours later, it would have taken 2 minutes to call me back and schedule an appointment. I will NEVER see him again.\", \"I was told I had bladder cancer without ever being tested for it. Then sent to a specialist who determined I didn't have it after testing but told for a fee of $5000 I could be DNA tested to see if I had the gene. I was have Pap test done by her and told I had HPV then later found out through a real gynocologist that I did not have it. Was told I had a hot appendix and to just go home and if I started to run a high fever to just go to the emergency room. I was given multiple psychological drugs which caused my problem to worsen because I started having suicidal thoughts and over dosed on the meds she prescribed for depression. Then over a $600 dollar bill owed to her but because of the psychological drugs wasn't able to work to earn the money to pay her bill I was told I could no longer come back to the facility and be seen by her or any other doctors in that facility again. In my own opinion she is not a good doctor in any way. Creates issues that are not there and the ones you do have are not treated with expertise. A really good doctor to see is Doctor Amy Miller she all about you and your health and working to help resolve your health issues and she doesn't believe in prescribing meds unless there is no other alternative. Great Doctor. I would not recommend Dr. Day to anyone. Just my opinion!\", 'I made an appointment to see Dr. Alvarez for a medical issue I was having. In the time between making the appointment and the date I found out I am pregnant. I have been under his care in the past, I have had 2 miscarriages while his patient. I arrived for my appointment and was rudely informed that my appointment had been rescheduled. I was never informed of this reschedule and when I questioned why I wasn\\'t informed and who rescheduled the appointment the receptionist stared at her computer screen and with a lack of care said \" I dunno\". That was my apology \"I dunno\". I rescheduled for the next week. That morning I had some bleeding and feared I was having a miscarriage once again. When my husband and I arrived we had to refill out all of the paperwork that we had filled out in the past. The same receptionist would ask for my insurance card and license and then close the glass on me as I was standing waiting for the cards back. She called me to the window 4 different times to go over paper work. My husband asked her if she could review the paper work and call me to the window once because I was not feeling well. She rolled her eyes at him and closed the glass. She asked for his credit card and closed the glass on him. He opened it and asked her why she keeps on closing the glass in our face and why she doesn\\'t say please and thank you when given a piece of ID or credit card. She rolled her eyes at him and she said \"don\\'t touch the glass\" and proceeded to close the glass in her face. I spoke with the doctor letting him know that I am working with an acupuncturist/ herbalist for my miscarriage issues. In the past he had sent me to a friend (the friend\\'s wife is a patient of his and also works for a large insurance company that is responsible for renegotiating the terms with the doctors) that is an IVF specialist. The IVF specialist was not a match for me and my husband so we decided to go the more holistic route. I told Dr. Alvarez that I feared that I was miscarring the pregnancy and he stood with his arms crossed and dropped me from his care for working with the acupuncturist. He did not want me to explain who I was working with or what she is doing. He told me that I seemed very angry (I think I am having a miscarriage at this point and was rudely handled by his staff) and could not longer work with me. He did not apologize for the mishap with the appointment the week before just said \"we didn\\'t do it to upset you\". I have NEVER had a doctor drop me from their care. I was under his care when I had the past 2 miscarriage and here I am, in tears, sitting in his office thinking I may be having a third and because he doesn\\'t understand acupuncture (and frankly doesn\\'t care to). He told me he would not see me. He told me after the 2nd miscarriage when I inquired about a specialist that the standard is to wait until a woman has 3 miscarriages before sending them to a specialist. If you have ever had a miscarriage you know how emotionally and physically taxing it can be on a patient. You are just a statistic if you go to this doctor, that is all you are.', 'My PCP sent me to Neurology because we needed to find out if the severe pain I\\'m having is related to my Fibromyalgia or if my cancer is part of the cause. My extremely rare type of non-Hodgkins Lymphoma can cause Peripheral Neuropathy. Dr. Quigley asked me what I did for a living. I explained that I hadn\\'t been able to work for over a year because of the severe pain all over my body, and my immune system is very poor from my cancer so I get sick a lot being around people. She asked if I was getting Disability, I told her I filed and was still waiting to hear back from Social Security. She then got very short with me; asking how I was able to live. I told her my father was helping me. She rudely asked me if my father had a really good job to be able to take care of me while I did nothing. She continued to interrogate me and tried to make me feel bad. She gave me wrist splints and told me to exercise. She then decided I was a drug addict and put \"Opioid Dependence\" on my medical record.', 'Dr. Audrey Miller delivered my daughter in 2010. She is no longer there. I went in and was seen by Dr, Paige for suspected endometriosis, fibroid, severe pelvic pain, and severe lower back pain. I have had a previous laparoscopy in 2008 in a different city and they suspected endometriosis. Two ultrasounds could not find my ovaries, exactly what happened in 2008. Instead of scheduling a laparoscopy to get the biopsies to confirm endometriosis and hopefully free up my ovaries, I was told to take a hormone to see if my pain eased. Which, by the way, would take at least 30 days to even start to take effect. Currently I cannot work, perform basic functions, and have to have help with the 5 year old that was delivered at this office. Basically told to deal with it, even it meant laying in the bed. This is unacceptable and I will not tolerate it. I want my issue taken care of. I wanted someone to at least do the laparoscopy to confirm endometriosis and fix what they can. That is standard, generally, in the diagnosis of the endometriosis. The people at the front were great. I spent more time up front and with the intake nurse than I did the doctor. It was as if my concerns did not matter. My well being and pain did not matter. As a patient, I have a choice in the doctors I see because essentially, my insurance pays them as well as myself. I have two other OBGYN appointments next week because I am going to find a doctor that will work with me and get this issue fixed. Regardless of the common \"chronic\" conditions. Your ovaries should never be stuck to your uterine wall. I was literally disregarded and will never go there again. I will never refer a person here as well. Patients do have rights and I for one, will be exercising mine.', 'I was a walk in VBAC as i went into labor early and was not able to see my OB. Aside from the disrespectful way she spoke to me she directly violated my DEMAND not to be touched. I refused permission for her to force me to birth reclined. I was pulled to the end of the table by force. I refused connect to have her reach inside my body to manually put traction on my placenta. As a VBAC such traction was much more dangerous than the tear she was in a rush to stitch. It took me 6 months of care from another provider to repair the damage she did with her stitching she did. She was rough and used thread that was FAR to thick. aproxapatly 18 gage running stitch. She treated me this was after being told by my husband that I had been sexually abused in the past and it was important to be respectful when touching me. There were no warningings before she reached in my body.', 'Dr. Jamal is the worst Dr I have ever met. I suffer and live with the frustration of living with multiple medical problems and disabilities, including emotional and excruciating pain 24/7. I decided I did not feel comfortable having this Dr as my dr, so I left the testing center and decided I was not going back to him. I did not realize that my decision was going cculminate my expulsions from the entire medical group, but it did. This is a Catholic medical group I was told that I could no longer receive medical care from. That Dr and my former primary Dr are not Catholic, but work for the Catholic medical group. I am Catholic and prefer receiving medical care from the Catholic healthcare system. So these doctors I was not able to work with, however, there are over 1500 primary doctors and specialists in the network that I no longer have access too. I have been flagged on their computer system not to schedule any appointments, if I contact any of the doctors in the network. The only way I am going to know whether or not the doctor or specialists in the network, until I contact that individual office and try to make an appointment, only to be told they are not allowed too, because they are part of the network I am not allowed to receive care from. Talk about stress, especially when suffer, live with all of these mmedical, disabilities, pain, sstiffness, numbness and tingling and emotional and there is nothing medical science can do to help mi imizs my excruciating pain. The doctors, medical and administrative staff that dismissed me have no caring or compassion to working with patients. I am a difficult patient in terms of the frustration I live with everyday with all of my health, disabilities, etc, not that I want to be difficult, but it is the way things are with me. I cannot not leave all of my medical problems at the door, accept what I am seeing that specialist or doctor for. These are apart of me.', 'How do you thank someone for saving your life? I am trying to figure that out, but I will start by sharing my story so that others can be blessed by Dr. Willis. After a year of suffering from long, heavy periods, a nurse at another hospital\\'s ER discreetly told me that I should see Dr. Willis because he save her life. He was pretty much my 5th opinion. In a nutshell, he ordered a pelvic MRA - a test no other doctor even considered - and it identified a blood vessel malformation which required a hysterectomy - a \"no brainer\" of a decision. Dr. Willis\\'\\' \"hunch\" was right, and my life was literally saved by him. He was highly recommended by the woman who performed my MRA as well - she had had uterine cancer and also told me Dr. Willis saved HER life. When I consulted with my OB-GYN prior to surgery, she told me she knew and had worked with Dr. Willis and that \"he was the guy we called in when we couldn\\'t stop the bleeding\" This made me super confident in him performing my operation, which was made slightly complicated by the blood vessel malformation. Do not mistake Dr Willis\\' confidence for cockiness. He has a quirky sense of humor which makes you feel at ease (and as a doctor that deals with cancer patients I imagine you have to have that). He always, always made me feel like I could ask him anything, and he even gave me a hug when he knew I needed one. My surgery was on a Friday and he came to my hospital room both Saturday AND Sunday to check on me. Both before & after surgery he was available to answer questions I had PERSONALLY. For someone who is obviously busy, he makes time to make his patients feel comfortable and cared for. I hope that this review will help bless someone who needs help the way I did. I literally trusted him with my life, and am going to enjoy the rest of my life because of it.', 'I went to see Dr. Calapi because my Grandmother has Alzheimers and I was interested in being pro-active in preventing the disease in my life as well as I had been very fatigued at the time. I waited for almost 2 hours to see the doctor, which I was told was normal and not too bad. My appointment was at 10:00 am, I was in his office from 10:00 to 3:00 pm! After seeing the doctor I waited forever to recieve a \"free B vitamin shot\" and then have my blood taken for tests the Dr. felt were necessary. I assumed the Dr. would be prudent in the tests that he ordered and we did not discuss the specifics of what tests he was ordering. At the end of my visit I was charged $275 when on the phone I was told it would be $160. I felt the office was not very clean, and not a pleasant place in general. Over crowded, under-staffed. What has been most distressing to me is the cost of the tests! $1,200! I do, luckly have insurance and the ultimate cost was closer to $750 but due to deductibles I have paid most of that out of pocket and now the labratory is sending me a bill for additional amounts not paid by my insurance. I cannot believe someone would order so many tests without informing a patient of the potential costs. I have not returned to see the Dr. as I am not interested in waiting 2 -3 hours to be seen and am angry about the lack of communication in the costs.', \"I will preface this with saying that I typically do not make reviews online (I don't think finding a doctor on yelp or any online site is the most credible way to find reliable care), but I felt it necessary to do so after my experience with Dr. Robbins. My husband and I were referred to Dr. Robbins by our daughters pediatrician after it appeared that her blocked tear duct was not relieving itself. She was 14 months old at the time of our initial appointment. I was very apprehensive about the procedure she would be receiving (and I will just put it out there - I hate hospitals/doctors offices in general). I consider myself to be not easily impressed by health care these days and difficult to please, especially when it comes to the care my daughter receives. From our initial consultation and every appointment thereafter (pre and post operation) and follow up, I found myself thinking how grateful I was that I was referred to see Dr. Robbins. Not only did she explain every bit of information I could ever want to know about the diagnosis, cause and cure for my daughters blocked tear duct - but she took her time with us, reviewing the procedure and answering the many questions we had. We went ahead with the surgery (I was a nervous wreck despite it being such a short surgery - I am a mom after all), and Dr. Robbins was sure to see us before, and immediately after she finished the surgery. At all times, I never questioned Dr. Robbins and knew we were in good hands. We just followed up on Tuesday and she is cured. Everything went just perfectly. I read through the reviews below and was pretty shocked by what I read. I feel like I need to say something about these reviews: 1) Everyone has bad days, reviewers and doctors alike, so that should always be taken into account. 2) THIS IS OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. Doctors have a lot of patients, there are typically long waits - and you should be prepared for that. I brought (to our initial appointment that we were TOLD was going to be 3-4 hours long an entire bag of toys, food, water, milk... etc). I also knew that the time I was scheduled was going to go into my daughters nap time. So I prepared myself for a cranky baby. 3) During each of my visits, I payed attention to the information being told to me and retained that information. I read the materials that were given to me and I did my research online. I seldom needed information repeated because I put my emotions on the shelf and LISTENED. -end rant- Overall, Dr. Robbins was professional, extremely intelligent/knowledgeable, and courteous. As an added bonus, she was always so sweet to my daughter (she has children of her own so she is a natural!). I really could not have asked for more - except maybe that the procedure and visits be paid for! Thanks for everything!\", 'After my insurance switched, I needed to find a new doctor. Dr. Mcguire was recommended to me by several people. Unfortunately, I never saw him and always had appointments with the nurse practitioners. I was never satisfied and I found that they were NOT thorough. When I went in showing symptoms of the flu and expressed concern of getting my 3 yr old daughter sick, she concluded that I probably had a sinus infection and never tested me. The next week my daughter was diagnosed with the flu and then gave it to my husband. A few weeks later, I went in for severe anxiety attacks. I had a trip for work to NYC scheduled in the following few days and have a severe phobia of flying. I have anxiety attacks and shake and cry before boarding. It is terrifying and incredibly embarrassing. The NP prescribed Zoloft for my anxiety which takes 3 weeks to take effect. When I asked her if there was an immediate Rx she could give me bc my flight was in two days, I asked her what I was supposed to do. She told me I needed to figure out a way to cope. Needless to say, I left very upset and angry. I switched doctors that day and will NEVER go back.', \"I am a type 1 diabetic. I think very highly of Dr. Siddiqui, but am currently searching for a new endocrinologist because I find her expectations to be very strict. She's the second endocrinologist i've seen (the first I was seeing for 10 years and only left because I needed to switch from a pediatric to an adult endo).My other doctor expected me to visit once every 3 months, when Dr. Siddiqui wants me to visit every 4-6 weeks. This is very inconvenient for my schedule between my work and school schedule. In addition, she expected me to chart every blood sugar reading, insulin dose, and carb I eat (because she thought my 8.0 a1c was horrible. I know it's not perfect, but I also don't think it deserves the attention of a 14.0 a1c). My other doctor NEVER expected this of me, so it was very overwhelming. She wanted me to fax this information weekly, which once again was very difficult with my schedule and was also unnecessary and stressful. I hated appointments because it felt like being chastised for not charting all of my information. I would highly recommend Dr. Siddiqui to any diabetic who needs heavy structure and guidance, however if you are a very busy person and do not want this kind of strictness then I would advise against.\", 'Dr. Cobb is undoubtedly the worst doctor I\\'ve ever come across, and I\\'m leaving this review so that others can be informed as to how bad some doctors truly are. Before I begin, I would like to add that I myself am a primary care physician, and only came to Dr. Cobb for a brief visit while I was in town due to some palpitations I was experiencing. She had no clue I myself am a physician, and here is my horrid experience with this incompetent doctor. First of all, I was seen 1.5 hours after my appt time. I almost got up to leave it was such a ridiculous wait time, but my wife encouraged me to stay since we had already stayed long enough. I agreed and after 1.5 hours I was called back. No apology from the MA whatsoever. As she asked me why I was there, I explained I was experiencing some new onset palpitations and I needed to see my dermatologist. Mind you this is the first time I am seeing Dr. Cobb as I was trying to establish a new primary care physician in the area. The MA took down my complaints and walked out of the room. After another 15 mins Dr. Cobb entered the room. Dr. Cobb entered the room almost 2 hours later looking like she had just woken up from a nap and offered no explanation as to why she was late, no sorry, no apology, nothing. I go on to explain about my palpitations, as well as needing to see my dermatologist for a skin condition I have. I explained I needed a refill on a medication for my psorasis, and I could not remember the name. I explained that the medication started with the letter \"D,\" and which was a Vitamin D derivative. Dr. Cobb without hesitation looked at me and said \"We don\\'t use Vitamin D derivatives to treat psoraisis.\" WHAT??!! Dr. Cobb has no idea that I am a physician myself and completely cut me off and said I was wrong in that there is no such medication. I looked at her with shock and said yes there is, I\\'m sure it\\'s in my file. This lady did not even check and proceeded to tell me she has no idea what I was talking about and that I needed to speak with a dermatologist about that. The medication I was referring to, which Dr. Cobb is completely clueless about, was Dovonex, which is a synthetic form of Vitamin D that is used to slow skin cell growth, flatten lesions, and remove scaling. Without even trying to look up my medications, she completely cut me off and gave me 100% false information and had no clue that synthetic Vitamin D derivatives such as Dovonex ARE used for the treatment of psoraisis. Unbelievable. Now, It doesn\\'t take a genius doctor to understand that if a patient is presenting with palpitations there are some basic tests that must be done to evaluate a patient\\'s systems. These include an EKG, holter monitor, basic blood work to look for conditions such as hypterthyroidism which can cause palpitations, etc. Or how about a quick listen to the hear, lungs, and checking of the pulses which can sometimes show conditions such as A-Fib. Do you think Dr. Cobb did any of these things? NO. Unbelievably she did not listen to my heart, lungs, did not order an EKG, nor did she offer to test me with a Holter monitor which is a 24 hour continuous EKG of a person\\'s heart rhythm. She did absolutely nothing nor did she seem interested in offering me these tests. In fact none of these tests or my palpitations was brought up after our discussion on the Vitamin D medication. Again Dr. Cobb had no idea I am also a physician so her incompetence on the basic fundamentals of being a physician were so clear that at this point I wanted to just leave. In the end I waited 2 hours to see a physician who offered no apologies for being late, cut me off and spoke down to me regarding the Dovonex medication, and flat out told me false information regarding the medication, spoke as if she was completely disinterested in my complaints, and offered no tests to check for my palpitations, and did not even conduct a basic physical exam. Mind you this was my first time meeting with Dr. Cobb, and it was the worst interaction I\\'ve ever had. After only 10 mins she abruptly got up, and said she would be right back. I thought she had left to check something, but to my amazement she was back with my discharge papers telling me have a nice day. WHAT A JOKE! The reviews you see about how Dr. Cobb is great are made up by family and friends, they are false ratings that doctors frequently do to boost their credibility online. Truth is Dr. Cobb is highly incompetent, and if you question what she is telling you her arrogance comes right out. Truth is she was rude, and had absolutely no bedside manners, something which is very important in the field of medicine. Do not go to this doctor if you can avoid. There are many other internal medicine doctors that are truly better, and I was able to find a new PCP who in fact ran blood tests, the EKG, and referred me for holter monitor testing. Something Dr. Cobb had absolutely no clue about.', \"I have arthritis in many joints. This condition has radically increased over the last few months to where my pain is at 8,9,or 10 depending on what I am doing. Dr. Kavanaugh did not address any of this even after I told him is now extremely difficult for me to get up out of a sittling position or to walk any distance. I have Parkinson's. The only comment he made was re the number of meds I am on. So he prescribed 2 more. First one is an antibiotic even though I do not have an infection but because it sometimes seems to help some people who have arthritis. And don't give up on it because it can take 1-2 months to notice any effect. The second Rx is a pain killer, but I have to call my neurologist to see if it is OK for me to take this med. And come back in 4 months. My neurologist said ABSOLUTELY do NOT take this med (Tramadol) because it will interfere with one of my Parkinson's meds. Vicodin or percoset or several others would be OK but NOT Tramadol.The appointment with Dr. Kavanaugh was a waste of time. He left me to suffer without hope for 4 months. He brushed off my request to consider cortisone injections for relief. He gave no explanation. I will find another doctor.\", \"What an awesome doctor and staff! Dr. Redstone did my breast reconstruction after my prophylactic mastectomy and I couldn't be more pleased with the results. His tremendous skill is matched by his commitment to giving his patients the best possible outcome. When my husband and I first met with him to discuss my options, he was clear, patiently responded to questions, and made us both feel confident that I would be in good hands. The day of the surgery, he spent extra hours in the OR to make sure that he was 100% happy with the results. His work was superb and I was able to look at my new body with not only acceptance, but joy! A month after surgery I unexpectedly started to develop an infection. When I called the office over that weekend, he responded immediately, came from the city to NJ to meet me at the hospital, and kept in close touch. The infection was quickly resolved. If you are looking for a doctor (and staff) that treats you with skill, respect, and caring, I would highly recommend Dr. Redstone.\", \"Dr. Savalia is the most unhelpful doctor I've ever met. She always looks rushed from the first second she sees the patient to the last minute. Everytime I visited her, she has never resolved any problem. Also if I ask about more than one problem in my body, she wants me to make another appointment even if the first problem took only 3 minutes for her to give me useless advice. I only chose her because all other doctors in the neighborhood didn't seem to accept new patients. Well there is a reason why she is not popular. It may be better to see a nurse at the walk-in clinic. I'm not going back to her anymore. Insurance: Blue Cross / Blue Shield\", 'I can not believe all the great reviews for Dr. Mackoul. I had a terrible experience with him. His bedside manner is the worst I have ever encountered--I have had 4 other surgeries and have never, ever had such poor care before. He does not treat patients as people, but problems. I was having surgery to deterime if endometrosis was present and he was actually joking to me and my mother saying wouldn\\'t it be easier to remove my ovaries instead and \"you didn\\'t want kids anyway, right?\" (I was 26 at the time). When presented with questions and concerns he seemed irritated and annoyed that I would want to know what was happening to me. I was taken back and prepped for surgery and then had to wait for 2 hours and no one from the medical team came to tell me what was going on. It was only by the grace of a very kind nun visiting the hospital that I had some company and comfort. I then went to the doctor\\'s office for a follow up and to have an IUD inserted with the other doctor in the practice and a nurse practioner. They were unprofessional and I have now learned from my current Dr the IUD was inserted improperly and now I will have a challenge having it removed.', \"I was having sharp pain in my left leg from thigh to all the way to the ankle, when I stand or walk a few minutes, for 5 months in 2012.

Not long after I found out I had the tumor I received a call from a doctor who sits down with you and discusses what treatment options you have. He called me and stated that if they could do surgery then there was nothing they could do. I went to see Dr. Helmstedter at that time my tumor was to big to operate on, but he did not just send me away. He sat me down and explained some treatment options I may want to try (Isn't that what the other guy was supposed to do Thank you Helmsteder)in order to shink it. After a few treatments I had two surgerys which Dr. Helmstedter performed. I had faith and it helped that I completely trusted my doctor. There is no doubt in my mind that had I gone to another doctor my results would not be as well as they are. Helmstedter is caring and honest. He never gave up.\", 'Dr. Seam \"Treated\" my father for stage four cancer. She lied to my family by saying his condition was getting better when in reality it was getting worse. She then gave up on treated him and told us we should put him into a hospice. I agree with the previous comments that she simply did not want to spend kaiser\\'s money on treating my father and further. I am also going to do everything in my power to report her to the medical board and make sure other patients due not receive this unacceptable care again. She was terrible at explaining the diagnosis and had no sense of sympathy or compassion one should expect from an oncologist. I would absolutely not recommend her to anyone.', 'Dr. Clapper was continuously rude and dismissive and generally unpleasant from the get-go. But lousy bedside manner didn\\'t matter much to me as long as he was a good surgeon. The doctor was all-business and overbearing in the pre-op area and operating room, acting like an ultimate dictator and with strict military style control and demand for respect. He truly is, or was the head doctor and he had a long-term reputation among the staff as a harsh authoritarian. His underlings fear and respect him, for whatever reasons. But again, that drill sergeant attitude is fine with me, as long as it produces positive results. I am taking the time to write this report because it is vitally important that people realize the genuine mistreatment they could be subjected to if they choose to allow this doctor to partake in their medical care. My truthful and provable complaints about Dr, Clapper are as follows: He performed an outpatient surgery on me that was quickly obvious to be unsuccessful. I soon had more pain, swelling and disability than before he performed the procedure. I was not angry by this disappointment, and was very willing to concede that nobody\\'s perfect and to give him another chance to get it right. I called his office, many many times and left him many many messages and he never returned a single message. He ignored me for many many weeks, and my symptoms got worse and worse. It was obvious that I needed immediate medical attention, yet he would not work me into his full schedule to see me. He ignored me in every way, caused my medical condition to escalate, and also told other doctors, nurses and Member Services that \"nothing was wrong with me\". Even though he had not seen me, spoke with me, evaluated me, he had the disgusting dishonest and dishonorable gall to refuse me my needed medical care and then lie about it. He refused to acknowledge failure, refused to act responsibly, and he caused me extra pain and grief in doing so. I was finally provided another doctor who could see me and it was so obvious that I was in need of urgent surgery to correct an immediate problem. I had the surgery by a different doctor, and the pain and debility was exacerbated unnecessarily for months due to one man, Dr. Clapper! To this day Dr. Clapped has still never responded to any of the many pleas for help and messages I sent to him, and he has NEVER APPOLOGIZED for the damage he caused. Dr. Clapper should have been suspended temporarily for his terrible mistreatments and malpractice, but he should have been FIRED permanently for lying about his unthinkable deeds.', \"Dr. Bamlett did 2 surgeries on my knee in a 3 year time span, my first when I was 19 the second when I was 22. He was very rude and has never told me what he did during surgery. I have since sought the opinions of other orthopedic doctors in the area and have been sent to 3 differnt doctors to try to fix what Dr. Bramlett messed up. All 3 doctors made comments on one thing or another Bramlett did wrong in my two surgeries. My most recent doctor is re-evaluating me for surgery and wanted to see my arthoscopic pictures from the most recent surgery (less than a year ago) and there are not any. Apparently Bramlett didn't think it was important to take pictures this time, nor did he do a MRI before surgery a second time. Im now being told I may need a partial knee replacement, which would be fine if I wasn't 23 years old! I strongly recommend you NOT see Bramlett for anything. My primary doctor (not the same as before my 1st surgery) told me he would NEVER send a patient to Bramlett\", \"I am an older lady married to an ophthalmologist (eye surgeon) and throughout the years have met and communicated with many doctors in various branches of medicine. I have fortunately never met anyone like Dr. Evensen. The first appointment was for an evaluation of an extremely painful knee. I had a few questions to ask the doctor and after looking at the X-rays, she asked me if I would like physical therapy. She then excused herself to take a phone call. I waited and waited and she never returned. Finally an assistant said she was with another patient and all they could do for me was schedule PT. I tried PT to no avail for over two months and the therapist recommended that I return to my doctor for further evaluation. I was unable to get any appointment for 2 months with Dr. Evensen and wanted desperately to speak or communicate with the doctor to find out what to do for pain relief. She does not (at least in my case) return phone calls or be available by email. The best I could do was reach a voice mail of an assistant who was to call me back. Just to reach the voice mail took me over 40 minutes and the phone rang and rang and I used two phones to finally get the operator to locate an assistant to talk to me. On my request, I then went in for a cortisone injection with Dr. Evensen's PA. I have had two cortisone shots in the past and not only have they helped, but there was just a pinch and pressure and no pain during the injection. This time, the PA warned me she doesn't numb the area and when asked if there would be excruciating pain, the PA responded that she had never had one herself and it depended on my pain tolerance. I have never experienced such pain before, even after surgery, and the PA explained she was holding my leg so I couldn't kick her. My blood pressure went very low and a nurse in the room insisted on getting me food and icing the leg and having me sit until I felt less shaky. She was the only caring person I met. I am going to be seeing an orthopedist, Bob Yin, MD, who has marvelous reviews and was educated at Columbia. I don't believe Dr. Evensen even diagnosed my problem correctly and certainly added to my pain and caused me mental anguish. Run, don't walk (if you don't have a bad knee) from this uncaring doctor, who spends next to no time in diagnosing a disorder. Update: In March, I went for a second opinion to Bob Yin, M.D. He ordered an MRI which showed a meniscus tear, which could involve surgery and since Dr. Evensen's only recommendation was to go to a rhuematologist that she recommended as she did not know the cause of my pain and thought perhaps he could help. I cancelled the appointment with the rheumatologist when I was told by Dr. Yin that the situation was orthopedic rather than rheumatological.\", \"I picked Dr. Singla by her experience. I knew nothing other than she had received excellent training. I had a severe reaction to grass particle inhalation and had pulmonary edema. My PCP wanted me to see a pulmonologist. She did the pulmonary functions test. I also complained of right side pain in my rib cage. She told me it was because of my breast implants and wouldn't listen to me. She told me to see a plastic surgeon. He did not make a diagnosis of the pain coming from my implants, but that I had a bleb and pleurisy, which was very painful. I stopped seeing her immediately because of bedside manner. I lost confidence in her immediately as she was treating my husband and myself. I think she thought I was seeking pain medications. Not true. She didn't even try to find out what was wrong, since it had been several weeks since I had the CT scan. It took me almost 3 months to recover from the allergic reaction from the grass. Started allergy shots and was taken off the meds Dr. Singla had put my husband and I on. So beware. I would think she would be an excellent Dr., but since I have worked in the operating room scrubbing cardiac, neuro and trauma surgery, I know when to seek other medical care. She sort of mocked me. Won't stand for that type of Doctor who is supposed to find out what the problem is and not just assume her thoughts are correct.\", 'I went to Dr Etkin Kramer over 10 years ago and remember liking her a lot. I recently went back to her once because she is close to where I live and thought it would be easier for me than to travel to my other doctor. I had to wait over an hour to see her and while they were checking my weight and standard things, her staff asked if I wanted routine tests because they were covered by insurance. I thought, \"sure, why not just make sure everything is fine\". I then get bills from Quest for over $850 for my \"routine\" tests. I called my insurance and quest. They did not send in the info correctly. So they resubmitted and of course the testing only covered partially. I ended up paying $543 out of pocket for a routine check up. I will not be going back to this doctor. Ever.', \"I contacted Dr. Careaga's office and spoke with one of his representatives, Yami (s), and made an appointment for a juviderm consultation. To my surprise, I was taken directly into the room without talking to Dr. Careaga or the rep. I expressed my concern and Dr, Careaga met with me briefly and told me how many injections I needed. I addressed my main concern which was bruising and was told that it happens but if I calm and did not move, Dr. Careaga would be able to do his work and bruises will be minimum. I told them i was going on vacation and perhaps i should wait; the rep told me she got them and went on a cruise after a couple of days. Needless to say, I was convinced but to my surprise even though I applied ice, the next morning the area around my mouth was heavily bruised and after 4 days after the procedure, I do not see any improvement. I think that it they had told me the truth about the possibility that the bruising could be heavy, I would've still done it but after my vacation. Very unhappy to have to travel with my face all bruised up after 5 days of the treatment.\", 'I\\'m so glad that over a dozen years ago, I chose Dr. Hidalgo to re-do my impants.  They look just as good or maybe even better now than when he first did them (and this after breast-feeding my 5 year old for 2 years).\\nI\\'d had my first implants done a few years before by a doctor in Los Angeles who had taken it upon himself to use a larger implant than what I had asked for.  \\nHis explanation was, (not surprising as we\\'re talking about L.A. here) \"everybody always comes back to me wanting to go bigger.\"  What an ass.  He also couldn\\'t have been more wrong in my case.  So I spent the next few years feeling self-conscious and uncomfortable.  \\nI had also been unhappy with the results of past lipo, performed by yet another unsatisfactory dr.  \\nI wanted to minimize v minor saddlebags.  But I had not one bit of cellulite anywhere, and my butt was pretty good.  I ended up with slightly lumpy upper/outer thighs and a saggy butt since he chose to do me the \"favor\" of extending his substandard lipo to those areas as well. \\nI finally decided to do something about it and I researched quite a bit.  \\nI would have to admit to being a perfectionist and after my previous experiences,  Knowing that many doctors have p.r. firms on their payroll (beware the \"society\" plastic surgeon and I won\\'t even mention those with advertising everywhere) and wary of choosing the wrong dr. again, I was especially assiduous.  \\nI was consistently hearing and reading great things about Dr. Hidalgo that seemed very genuine and sincere.   I can only add more praise.\\nDr. Hidalgo gave me exactly what I wanted and was even able to improve the scar on my breast from my 1st surgery.  \\nHe sort of talked me out of doing lipo too, saying the improvements might not be worth the expense, etc. \\nHe and his entire staff, could not have been more sensitive and caring.  From the start and throughout the entire experience I was put at ease by the atmosphere of competence and experience in their office, and operating room.  \\nNow I\\'ve decided to go ahead and try to fix the lipo anyway, since it still bugs me to this day.  Unless Dr. Hidalgo told me to, I wouldn\\'t trust anyone but him to do it.\\nIt\\'s been my experience that whether you are talking about doctors or plumbers, it breaks down into there being a few bad ones, even fewer really good ones and the rest are pretty much mediocre.\\nI can\\'t recommend Dr. Hidalgo enough and I\\'m looking forward to my next procedure with him!', \"I've always been an athletic and active person so maintaining that lifestyle while pregnant was a goal of mine. I notified my coaches immediately so they could help me to stay safe & smart. I was halfway through my pregnancy before Dr. Brown was recommended to me. I wasn't very happy at the large group practice I was at so I decided to make the switch. What a great decision that was! Having a doctor that understood exactly what I was doing was priceless. Having clear instruction on which movements were okay and which ones weren't made me feel much more confident in the gym. Also, not feeling shamed for being so active was very important. I had Dr. Brown's full support and encouragement to keep it up. Even though I felt pretty sick in the first trimester I was able to maintain my 5-6 days-a-week class schedule up until the day my water broke! I have to admit that it was kind of nice being able to workout everyday and not worry about being so competitive. I was just enjoying keeping my baby and myself healthy throughout the process. If something didn't feel good on a certain day I would listen to my body and change the movement or even cut the workout short if need be. I gained approximately 30lbs throughout the pregnancy and had a very healthy 6lb 11oz baby girl at 39 weeks. My labor was about 15 hours and my body held up great. The nurses were impressed with how low my heart rate stayed throughout my contractions. When it came time to push it probably took less than 10 minutes! My recovery time was quick too. I was back in the gym after I got the okay from Dr. Brown at 4 weeks with a few limitations. I actually hit my pre-pregnancy weight even before that! The extra weight just fell off and I know I have CrossFit to thank for that. I'm so thankful to have had a healthy full term pregnancy and a healthy and happy baby. I will definitely be doing the exact same thing for baby #2 someday! \", 'I was diagnose with Alopecia and had lost hair on each side of my head on the temple as soon as I noticed and consulted a friend, I was recommended to go see Dr. Drimes, so I started getting hair treatment, which my insurance covered since it was a medical condition, I also went in for laser hair treatment on my chin and just to maintain my skin/skincare, which I have pretty good skin. I will say that Dr. Grimes really help me keep my skin fabulous, but due to the other treatments they made some major mistakes. The 2nd treatment for laser hair removal Malena tried to laser a little bit of baby hair on my side of my face and gave me hyperpigmentation, when I addressed it with Dr. Grimes she stated she didn\\'t want anyone to do my face except her and then gave me a sample of lighting cream. I informed them that why would Malena touch my face if I only pay for the chin area. Dr Grimes said she would give me a discount for that treatment. I felt insulted because they already charge $300 for 1 laser hair treatment so they reduced it to $200 then Dr. Grimes gave the front office manager products she recommended in a bag that came up to over $200. I told them I am not buying anymore products because everytime I visit they try to sell me products or get anymore laser hair treatments. Not to mention her office manager ask me for some free cosmetics because I work for one of the top cosmetic companies & she saw me give Dr. Grimes so cosmetics for her charity program. How unprofessional \"where is my free stuff since you want me to give you freebies\". When I told her that she got upset and never called me for my follow-up.To make things worse, when I went back for my last hair follow-up Dr. Grimes told me My hair was healthy & I didn\\'t need anymore treatments BUT..she said\" SHE WAS GOING TO DO IT ONE MORE TIME\" just to make sure. When she gave me the shot in my head she hit a bllod vessel, and I ended up in Cedar Hospital, out of work on medical leave for over a month, could not talk(lost voice due to swelling of the throat) keep in mind I go to school for classical voice/Opera.I was diagnose with HEMATOMA. My throat swollen up because I was allergic to the MEDs.I only take herbs & all natural stuff. I was eating baby for the whole time.This is what hurt me the most, when I told her what happen she asked me did I take any acne medication because it could trigger it and she said she didn\\'t give me a large dose. I WAS IN SHOCK! I HAD TO BE RUSH BACK TO THE HOSPITAL & BE PUT ON A IV MACHINE! STILL WAITING ON HER APOLOGY & THE HOSPITAL/AMBULANCE BILLS TO SEND HER! I COULDN\\'T BELIEVE HER RESPONSE, YOU WOULD THINK THAT PEOPLE WOULD CARE ABOUT PEOPLE MORE THAN MONEY, BUT IN THIS WORLD PEOPLE FEEL MONEY IS THE BEST BLESSING OTHER THAN GOD. I FEEL SORRY FOR THEM & PRAY FOR THEM EVERYDAY!', 'This doctor is the worst I have ever encountered in my life and I have been to a lot of dr. She is so cheap she only has interns work for free you never have the same nurse, and she must get the bottom of the barrel because the are awful. She is so worried about her liability she has the nurse write your vitals on a post it note and then puts what she thinks is reasonable so she has no liability. she would put a good blood pressure reading on my chart and send me out with a 215/110 and not record it. I found out when I had insurance she averaged 900. payment from my insurance company per visit as soon as I lost my insurance and was paying out of pocket and she could only make 70. a visit became so sub standard I had to sit outside the examining rooms and have my vitals and everything done in a hallway without any privacy.I was omitted to the hospital on an unrelated illness and she never returned my dr. at the hospital several and daily  phone calls the 2 weeks I was there to confirm I was on opiates and my doseages, so I went through the worst experience of my life and cold turkey withdrawal on top of being in extreme pain from my condition that brought me there.. To make matters worst she would not back me up in my SSI claim and threw me under the bus. She saw me for 4 year. and treated me for the condition she denied I had to ssi.

I chose this office because they did both and thought I would be happy with the results after going in for my consultation.  Little did I know I was in for a ride.  I was first told that my laser hair removal would take about 10 sessions and my tattoo at least 5.  I realize that they were not able to tell me the exact number it would take but now that I have spent A LOT of money I feel like they were just sucking me in little by little.  I was told that after 5 treatments on my tattoo that I would be very satisfied.  It is not even half way faded.  When I ask Dr White if she would be satisfied with the results after 5 visits of the tattoo removal her answer to me was \"\"oh, you wanted it completely removed.\"\"  Well thats what I came for right TATTOO REMOVAL!!  When I paid for my first package I was told that the laser hair removal would take 10 visits and the tattoo removal 5 visits.  Thats all that was said.  So when I paid I assumed I was paying for 10 sessions and 5 sessions.  Well after my tattoo removal package ran out, I was told that I only paid for 5 visits for both.  It was very very misleading.  During each session I was asked how happy I was and all along I had said well for the tattoo, I am going to need to see a lot of change since I only have a few more sessions but as for the hair removal I have at least 5 or 6, 6 or 7 (what ever the case may have been) left.  They never said anything about me only having 1 or 2 left.  The whole thing was a BIG let down.  Please, please reconsider if you are thinking about having anything done here.

I tried contacting her and her nurse called me back but I missed the call. I have called back three times now and no one has even attempted to call me back. Another note would be her not bothering to read my chart and not knowing about previous conditions and had no concern with even checking the simplest of things, my heart or lungs.

I was asked a few questions regarding how I have been feeling and if I have been exercising. My temperature was taken and then came the blood pressure test. Fingers crossed! To my surprise I was 115/75 yippee! I am very happy that Kaiser has their automated service that send out reminders. I do not think I would be taking care of myself as much if it weren't for them always keeping me on the ball. As I mentioned in my earlier review, I will continue to live, to YELP another day!

When she calls to follow up with him she is rude. She cuts him off when he is trying to speak and even tho he has seen her multiple times for the same thing, she REFUSES to prescribe his medication until he travels all the way to Baltimore for her poor services.

He was professional but made me feel like knowing how I felt was very important to him. I am so relieved that it was Dr. Brown who had to deliver the bad news of us miscarrying. He told us with the most sincere and kind heart. After allowing me to miscarry on my own, he alerted me that I must get a DNC a few days later. I absolutely hate hospitals and was a wreck until I saw him that morning and was told I would be alright. He is someone who I have gained complete trust in and the upmost respect for.

After having the procedure a nurse talked with me and said I would be call with the results. Someone called but I wanted more indepth information about the procedure and results.

The doctor had simultaneously crossed his wires by confusing the entire matter with a requirement that the generic was N/A in my case while telling the insurer that it was fine to do so! \\r\\n\\r\\nExpress-Scripts will not cover such costs since in writing the doctor had authorized a change to a lower cost and ineffective generic. \\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Express-Scripts would not pay the cost for the Uloric prescription refill unless there was a prior authorization and medical necessity letter on file at TRICARE which is my secondary insurer. The primary insurer had an acceptable prior authorization and medical necessity form on hand but this was insufficient for TRICARE. Dr. Nguyen\\'s staff initially stated that they did not support TRICARE claims. I asked to speak with the doctor after hours or at least someone who could take care of this administrative matter. This was not possible, and I was told I would have to wait 7-10 days for the doctor to get back to this issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring follow up calls I was told that they had received a request from TRICARE for a prior authorization form and a medical necessity form (recall I have been on this same medication daily for more than 2 years) and they would get it submitted. Last Friday, 6 December 2013 I asked to speak with the doctor (I was offered an appointment in February 2014) or someone on staff who could send the proper forms to the insurer, and I was told that the doctor had a signed medical necessity letter available for me to pick up. Their call was at 3:55 PM on a Friday and their office closed at 4 PM. I faxed a letter explaining the above details to the doctor and informed him that at present I am unable to refill the prescriptions he wrote for the same medications that I have been able to fill for the past 2-3 years. I asked for help and to speak with him to clear this up.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, 9 December 2013 I drove to the doctor\\'s office and picked up a letter stating I had a need for Uloric long term and no other medication  would work. \\r\\nI also was handed a letter telling me that I was upset with some of the services the doctor provided and that he had gone \"out of his way\" to attend to urgent matters (gout flare ups with the inevitable pain that he told me always to call and see him about- not more than 1-2 times the past 1-2 years) and numerous letters about medications and other matters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were 0 other matters to my knowledge outside of the issues with gout. The numerous letters were required by the insurer and clearly he or his staff mistakenly issued changes in medications that created a major issue when I tried to pay for the costs for the more expensive prescriptions.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have not had such problems with any medical service provider in the past 63 years. I would recommend the doctor for his medical knowledge, but not his business practice as they were unwilling to attend to matters that I did not create nor wanted. The doctor was unwilling or unable to at least discuss these administrative matters nor his staff. He is after all offering a service for a fee and not in business to do the patients a favor. It is clearly \"his way or the highway\" if one questions obvious administrative errors that make our lives more difficult. All of this began with a simple refilling and denial at CVS due to paperwork...\\r\\n\\r\\n', 'I just had my first child a month ago and was initially going to deliver at Desert Regional but I switched doctors late into my pregnancy and my new doctor only delivered at JFK. If you can deliver elsewhere like Desert Regional or even your home then please do so. I went in to be induced and the \"waiting room\" for mothers getting ready to be checked in was in the hallway of the recovery rooms of the other moms delivering. The check in process was quick and I got a room fairly quickly. The L&D nurses are a hit and miss. The first few nurses were pleasant and reassuring that everything would be OK. Once the shift switched to the PM nurses the whole attitude changed. I brought my own hospital gown that is approved to be used in hospitals and a nurse wanted me to take it off and use the hospital\\'s gown. After I showed her that my gown was hospital grade she said it would be OK for me to use my own and even gave me a compliment on how cute it was. I had a nurse by the name of Mariam who provided me with a pretty bad experience. I requested an epidural and I got one. A few hours later I kept asking the nurse if my epidural was working and she said that it was and that I would not be able to feel anything. Well I was in excruciating pain and requested that I talk to my doctor. I told my doctor that I felt that something was wrong because I could feel everything and I was not sure if I was going to be able to have this baby! She checked me out and she said that someone had unplugged my epidural and that I was receiving no pain medication. My doctor was not happy when she found out what had happened and of course all the nurses in the delivery room said that they did not unplug my epidural. To make a long story only a few of the nurses on the PM shift were pleasant and concerned with my birth experience. The others I felt were there for a paycheck. The nurses in the recovery area were far more pleasant. I understand that nursing is a demanding job and that nurses have to deal with a lot but the few nurses that were helping me showed no concern when I kept asking them why could I feel pain. One of them even said that there was nothing she could do I have to deal with the pain.', \"I have moved a great deal and had several gynecologists in different parts of the country. Dr. Blank is by far the best gyno I have ever had. He is professional, friendly, open, and works efficiently to get the job done. Ladies know when I say it can be an awkward experience trying to make conversation from over those stirrups. Dr. Blank has great bedside manner where he'll chat briefly when he enters the room to make you comfy, asks you about concerns, and spends the rest of the exam (with a nurse present) giving you a step-by-step of what he is doing next. There's no feeling awkward or guessing with him. After the exam, there is always a meeting in his office where he talks briefly about healthy lifestyles, then discusses the exam, and asks you about additional questions or concerns. I like these meetings because 1. I am a heavier woman, but the healthy lifestyles discussion is NEVER fat-shamy, just a general overview, especially if blood pressure and stuff are normal and 2. I feel like Dr. Blank genuinely cares when he asks for further questions or concerns. He has also always referred me to good other doctors, if I needed it. Lastly, I just moved to California from DC. Dr. Blank followed up through email about my move to say he could assist in finding another doctor and if I ever had any health concerns, could always reach out to him from afar. It was a very appreciated email and again, felt very sincere. I am going to miss Dr. Blank. A good gyno is worth their weight in gold, in my opinion. Those are some important parts down there that I want treated with care.\", 'We went to Troy Rustad for a second opinion on a spreading rash that would not go away (was over arms, legs, back, neck, stomach, etc). First he tried to give advice on respiratory allergies (even though he is not that kind of dr.). Then he stated that rash must be an allergy (to soap, detergent, etc.) as if it was a FACT, and said that the ONLY option was to stop all products, buy a full set of \"allergy free\" products, and come back to him. I tried to ask about the first opinion we received.He dismissed it as impossible/useless (again, as fact, not opinion). In the end, because I was suspicious (wondering if he somehow profits from the sale of the products he had on a pre-printed list for us), we followed the advice from our family doctor. (I.e., we used a stronger dose of oral steroids for a week). It worked. The rash has been gone more than a month. I\\'m so glad we didn\\'t follow his advice or buy all the products he so strongly tried to persuade us that we HAD to have. Be forewarned.', \"In the 12 years that I lived in the area, I had to visit Twin Cities only twice. Thankfully, there wasn't reason to visit more than that, as my experience with this hospital was shameful. There were two separate issues that I faced with Twin Cities: 1. When I visited the ER for a very bad case of strep throat, it took almost two hours to get anyone to acknowledge that I was there. Finally, a nurse took my temperature, blood pressure and the regular tests. It took another thirty minutes for a doctor to see me. When he finally did, it took him literally two minutes to use a tongue depressor and told me to come back tomorrow if I didn't feel any better. That's it. That's all the service I received. As I visited the payment window, the lady at the booth told me it would be $350, as I didn't have insurance at the time. Talk about a rip off! My symptoms weren't any better the following day, plus with the added weakness, I felt considerably worse. Two days later I visited Twin Cities again with a nearly play-by-play repeat of my first E.R. experience, again to the tune of $350. The only thing that changed is that the new doctor at least had the mercy to prescribe an antibiotic which helped a lot. Unfortunately my experience with Twin Cities wasn't over when I got home. A few weeks later I received a bill for several hundred dollars in inexplicable charges. Nothing was itemized by line, so I called the hospital and questioned the charges. Nobody could give me a straight answer, and this was on on top of the original payment window telling me I owed nothing else and wouldn't be billed beyond my initial payments. It turns out that Twin Cities parent company Tenet Healthcare has been involved in numerous class-action lawsuits for shady billing practices. I never did get a straight answer out of the hospital, then Tenet turned me over to ruthless collection agencies to collect the bogus charges. After a year-and-a-half, I was able to dispute them and remove the items from all three credit reports, because they never had documentation to justify the bills. Use this hospital as a last resort, but only if you are dying from a mortal wound.\", \"Dr. MacKoul performed a hysterectomy and partial oophorectomy on me, both laparoscopically, and my recovery was quick and free of complications. He is a very good surgeon. However, for the ovarian cancer, I had to wait almost a month for the final pathology report, and then had to try to get hold of him for two days after it came back. He did not explain the report to me very well (I had more questions than answers when he was done) and he brushed off questions about whether I would need chemo or radiation. He told me I could take HRT to relieve symptoms of menopause, whereas when I got a second opinion later, I was told that was not a good idea because ovarian cancers can be hormonally responsive. I was not overly concerned with a lack of bedside manner, that doesn't bother me, but lack of communication does. I agree that he seems mainly concerned with performing surgery rather than treating cancer. I went for a second opinion at UVa and will be going back there for my (hopefully last) surgery - to remove the ovary that Dr. MacKoul should have removed in the first place.\", 'My experience with Dr. Boucher was an unpleasant one. Now that I am older and part of the healthcare team myself I see just how detrimental her clinical judgement is. She not only wanted to perfrom and unnecessary leep procedure on me, but she then dropped me as a client for refusal of medical advice. Under the age of 21 your cells are changing and dysplasia occurs. This is why the new age for a pap smear is 21. However, when I was 16 she wanted to perfrom this procedure due to her misdiagnosis of HPV. I have had this checked by 3 other OBGYN doctors who have all stated I have never had HPV. However, I do have PCOS so if I had continued with this procedure my chances of becoming pregnant would have decreased even more. I really hope she has stopped these procedures and has researched evidence based practice articles to provide better healthcare to her patients. Before you have ANY procedure done by this MD. please seek a second opinion and do some research yourself.', 'I have known Dr. Matthews since soon after he began his practice. He has been my family doctor for the last year. His staff are always very personal, caring, compassionate and professional. They always schedule me in to see Dr. Matthews the day and time I need. On occasion, when it was urgent that I see Dr. Matthews or go to the emergency room, they got me straight in. I rarely have to wait more than 5 minutes in the waiting area. many times his office staff will come out to the waiting area and ask me if there is anything they can get or do for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Matthews always comes in to the examining room with a smile on his face, greets you and thanks you for coming to see him and then asks what he can do for you today. He sits there patiently and listens closely to every word you say. Then he may ask you questions and then will give you his opinion and diagnosis and recommended treatment. Then he will ask you what you think. He is never in a hurry and always asks if there is anything else he can do for you before leaving.\\r\\n\\r\\nA year ago I was diagnosed with prostate cancer. When I went in to discuss the results and treatment options, Dr. Matthews said, \"I have already recieved a copy of your test results and have reviewed them in detail\". He ask me my thoughts and what I thought I wanted to do. He explained the pros and cons of different treatments and helped me to understand why surgery was the right choice.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I ask where I should go, he responded, \"You know, if it were me and I had to make this decision today, I would go to Mayo\", which I did. I cannot thank him enough for sending me there. The surgery went text book perfect and Mayo was \"exactly as advertised\".   \\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Matthews was there for me before, during and after the diagnosis, surgery and recovery. I did all my follow up visits with him until I returned to Mayo for my 6 month check up.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Matthews is relentless when it comes to diagnosing a health issue, finding the cause and following through with the correct treatment. Dr. Matthews has personally called me several times to give me test results as he recieved them and to check that my medications were working effectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot imagine what my life and health would be like today if it had not been for Dr. Matthews and his staff. I would not have wanted to go through what I have with any other doctor. \\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Matthews not only cares about your physical, mental and emotional health and wellbeing but also about you as a person. He is one in a million. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he will always care for you and treat you just like, as his practice says, \"Family\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJM  ', 'When you go to see this Dr., be prepared to wait. I have had two surgeries done by this Dr. in the past year and on each initial and follow-up appointment he was never on time. After they eventually get you from the waiting room to an exam room, be prepared to wait again. Rarely, did the Dr. come into the exam room in less than a half hour after I had been placed. His staff will make you cringe and you will wonder where he found these people. Follow-up calls after surgery are answered by his assistant and one would wonder if he has an ounce of compassion or competence. My biggest mistake was ever having this Dr. operate on my spine. After one year I am no better than when I initially went to see him. I would recommend that anyone considering this group of surgeons to first get a second and even a third opinion prior to surgery. After all that was done to me surgically, it has been found that my problem emanated from my hip and spinal surgery may not have been necessary, Hope this helps others in pain.', \"Dr. Champaneri has been cold, disinterested, and unhelpful throughout the process of diagnosing and treating my hypothyroidism. For the first appointment I had with him, he dryly lectured me about hypothyroidism for over 30 minutes, without discussing any of its specific implications for my own life. I came to him because my GP would not test for the cause of my hypothyroidism, and I specifically told Champaneri several times that I came to him because I wanted to be tested for Hashimoto's thyroiditis. He agreed and appeared to take notes. However, when his assistant called with blood results, she knew nothing about this test and was very reluctant to mail me a copy of my own lab results. When the results arrived, Champaneri had NOT ordered the tests that he'd assured me he would. What a waste of my time & money! He made no attempt to explain these results to me, nor did he explain subsequent ones. Once my TSH dropped to an unhealthily low level, I was told to return in a year.\", 'Kaiser started my induction on because of my pregnancy induced hypertension by inserting a balloon into the uterus to irritate it naturally and start contractions. The only advice the nurse gave me was that, should the balloon come, it would mean I was about 5 cm dilated and to throw the balloon away. She did not indicate whether or not I should come in to the hospital. I feel patients should be advised that they ought to absolutely proceed to Labor and Delivery should their catheter come out, because 5 cm is serious - especially in a high risk patient like myself with a preemie baby. The nurse sent me home, and around 10:30 p.m., the balloon came out. Because I was in extreme pain, vomiting heavily, and pouring blood, I called the Labor and Delivery triage line and they told me to go to Kaiser Sand Canyon immediately. As we were leaving, a nurse from Sand Canyon called and told me the Irvine hospital was full and to go to Anaheim. I couldn\\'t make it that far - and was scared of the risk due to my child being a preemie, my high risk pregnancy and the severe amount of blood loss. In hindsight, it shocks me that a nurse would tell me to drive an additional hour to a hospital I have never visited due to overcrowding. As a high risk patient, I believe I should have been advised to go to the nearest hospital for medical attention. It frightens me to think what might have happened if I would have followed her direction as my labor advanced so rapidly and there were blood pressure and fetal distress issues. Once I arrived, I was placed in a triage room and the same nurse I spoke to on the phone (who told me to go to Anaheim) spent the first hour of my labor lecturing me about how I should have done what she told me because my room would have been nicer and she was swamped. She seemed extremely agitated that I was there, and refused to give me anything for my pain until the admission process was completed, though I was literally on all fours screaming. Rather than hurry up with the admitting process, she kept lecturing me about my poor decision to come to Irvine and how overburdened staff already was. I was transferred to another triage room once the midwife checked my cervix and said I was ready for an epidural. The nurse tried to start an IV and it blew out twice. She complained about how empty the room was - there was no gauze - and asked if I could believe she had to use a washcloth to stop my arm from bleeding. She used this as another example of why I should have listened to her and gone to Anaheim. It scared me that the delivery room I was in did not have the appropriate medical basics to care for me (like gauze). Once a second nurse was able to get an IV inserted successfully, they both failed to remember to hook the IV up to the actual fluids. My own mother, herself a labor and delivery nurse, arrived and offered to help hook up the fluids. When the nurse heard this, she announced she hated having fellow medical professionals in the room because it made her feel judged, and physically turned her own name tag around so we couldn\\'t see her name. Because of the delay in getting the IV hooked up to the fluids, my baby only got one dose of the required four to treat a medical condition. My mother also noticed that the fetal monitor was flat with no accelerations, and that there were decelerations during the peak of two contractions, and the nurse did absolutely nothing to respond. My mom suggested putting me on oxygen and turning me on my side, as my blood pressure was also skyrocketing. The nurse snidely said, \"Oh wow, the grandma doesn\\'t seem to be too happy with the strip!\" And made a rude expression. During my labor, the nurse kept announcing that, \"The baby\\'s strip looks horrible!\" And then would do nothing to respond. Her comments terrified me. When she went to check my cervix, she said, \"Oh wow, you\\'re losing so much blood. I don\\'t want to go near this, I\\'ll go find someone else to do it,\" with a tone of complete disgust in her voice. I also asked the nurse for water over and over during labor, and wasn\\'t given any for HOURS. I had to ask THREE TIMES. I also asked for a Motrin after birth, and wasn\\'t given any for HOURS. Because of this nurse\\'s decision to waste time lecturing me and failure to hook my IV needle to the fluid bag, I had to deliver with absolutely no pain medication. This was extremely traumatic for me. When I was screaming that I needed to push, the nurse said I just needed to get my breathing under control and to quit being dramatic. My mom had to demand she go and get a doctor, because she just stood around rolling her eyes at my screaming. After birth, I has to ask to do skin-to-skin with my own baby. Despite all the preaching from teaching staff about how valuable this is, the nurse failed to suggest or help me with this. I had to ask her numerous times to have skin-to-skin with my newborn. I would write more, but have exceeded the limit. My experience was beyond horrific.', 'There is only two negative things I have to say about my experience. The first is looking for the address of the facility is confusing. When we looked for it, we could not find it. After calling to the office and being on hold forever, we finally got through and was told that the number if the building is not in order. I feel as a new patient going in, they should let us know that the numbers of the building is not in order. The second complaint would be trying to call and having to talk to a machine. As I said earlier, you will be on everlasting hold. Needless to say, I finally found the office and was 15 minutes late. The receptionist at the desk was very kind to me. She knew my frustration and managed to calm me down as I thought I would not be able to see the doctor. When I got in the room to see Dr. Gingsberg, I was very very pleased. He is truly amazing. He has a good spirit and is very professional. He listens and takes his time. I felt so much at ease and left feeling like although I had a rough start, I would definitely visit him again if needed. ', 'My first time visiting with her and I will never go again. First of all, I went for a physical and prescription. The only thing I got out of it was a pap smear and breast check for lumps. She asked when was the last time I had my blood drawn, I told her 3 years ago and she asked about the results which came out normal. She then told me that she\\'ll see me next year for blood work. (Will I see her again? Probably not.) I asked her for a particular shot required for taking some classes and she just said that she\\'ll put an order in for it then never brought it up again. I was not told of a follow-up appointment or such for the shot that I asked for. In my paperwork I filled out, I asked for a couple of other testing, none was given. I felt like she just wanted me in and out. When someone else from her office called to do a follow-up on my prescription I had asked for, I asked about the shot and the person said that I didn\\'t need the doctor present to get the shot. I could just walk in and get the shot. My question is \"WELL HOW COME I WASN\\'T GIVEN IT THE DAY OF MY PHYSICAL? It didn\\'t matter if the doctor was to give the shot or not. It would save me time and money to be charged for another check-up.\" But my time or money is not of their concern, nor is my satisfaction as a new client. From the reviews on here, I thought she would have been more attentive but my visit was not up to par. Sad to say that I will not be returning.', \"Everything under review is correct about Dr Ibarra only problem is after seeing her many times for irregular heart beat and weakness throughout my whole body she could not find anything wrong with me.I had to go from an hmo to a ppo to find the root cause of me feeling this way.My mother took me to her doctor in Yuma AZ. After a few tests and and ultra sound the doctor found 2 large tumors in my uterus that with the size of them they are pressing against a major artery which restricts the flow of blood to my heart,hence the symptoms mentioned above.I am now setting appts to have a hysterectomy performed. Thank god they are not cancerous or wouldn't be alive to write this review\", 'the worst experience I have ever had a medical facility. We came here for my adult son\\'s Eczema. He was having a severe flare up and I suspected that it was infected. Since we couldn\\'t get into his Derm or Primary Care Dr we went to the ER. My son\\'s father was there to check him in. I was on my way there from work. I arrived about 45min after he was checked in. The rooms are ridiculously small and uncomfortably outdated. I can overlook that. What I can\\'t overlook is the bedside manner of the staff. The nurse\\'s eyes practically rolled out of their sockets when I started asking questions. I wanted to know what the doctor thought of his skin. Was it infected? Maybe staph? Does he need a blood test? After giving me a hard eye roll she mumbled that she was going to get the Dr ( I think that is what she said) and be right back. The Dr was horrid. She was condescending and totally unprofessional. She shot down every request I made and talked to me as if I was stupid for even thinking that he needed a blood test. \"his vital signs are better than anyone else on this floor\" & \" staph is on everyone\\'s skin\" in her best condescending tone. We left with feeling no compassion from anyone in that hospital except maybe the coordinator that had no problem taking my $150 co/pay. The charlatan sent us with a few scrips. Upon researching the scrips i realized she prescribed something for his skin that was completely wrong and nothing close to what was going on. A few days later we got into Phoenix Skin Derm and the dr there told us that yes in fact his skin was infected and they prescribed the correct antibiotics. If you have no experience with an area of health then ask for a second opinion by another doctor or at least show some compassion. WOULD NEVER GO BACK! I would drive 20 minutes in any direction to go to any other hospital', \"My father was recently admitted to the ER at UCSD and had the misfortune of seeing Dr Leslie Marie Martin. On her first visit with my father they talked and joked around. The following day she saw him, he was in a bad mood cause he had a bad day. Right there and then she decided my dads case was hopeless. She even went as far as telling my mother that SHE should spend the night in the hospital with my dad, indicating that she didn't think he would make it through the night. She wanted to tell my dad that he was dying and his only choices were to stay in the hospital or go home. We told her we wanted to wait to tell him as a family and made arrangements for my sister and two nieces to fly in from out of state. Before they arrived the next morning, she took it upon herself to inform him that she wanted to talk to him but we were awaiting their arrival. Hearing this bit of information was enough to let him know his future was bleak. My dad was informed of his situation and decided to come home. Today is day 6 and he is still with us. I want to tell you all not to let her bully you around. We should have complained to the hospital and gotten a new doctor. My dad is over 70 years old, and has several medical issues to deal with so we know he is not going to live forever, but he has a strong will and has beaten the odds before and proven his doctors wrong.\", 'Doctor Horst is part of the machine. if you are pregnant and planning on having him deliver your baby, be aware that he thinks that \"every woman tears during her first birth,\" which means that he has no intention of trying to minimize these tears or minimize the necessity of an episiotomy, which could lead you to having an unnecessarily painful recovery after giving birth. just imagine trying to heal from third degree tears while you are caring for a newborn baby. not the best time. second, he\\'s on a mission to deliver the baby FAST. during the delivery of my first child, he said, \"we can have this baby out in 15 minutes.\" i made it very clear to him that i would like to take the birth more slowly, if possible, to allow my body to adjust and to minimize tearing. not with this guy. he is so clueless. he was more interested in getting out of the delivery room and on with his life than he was about my wellbeing. i was more educated on pregnancy health than he was. he is a \"by the book\" kind of guy, definitely not the kind of guy to go above and beyond his duties. i found his demeanor to be friendly but false. you could see right through him. it was obvious that he couldn\\'t have cared less. if you are looking for a doctor who is going to listen to you and make decisions in your best interest, this is not your guy. he is concerned with delivering a healthy baby (as we all are!), yet has no interest in taking care of the mother or her body.', 'Last year, on August 30, 2010, I went to Weiss Hospital for a sexual assault exam in the ER (sorry- big TMI, but this is serious). The previous night, I believed I was drugged at a party & was unsure as to whether I had been assaulted, but suspected this was the case. I was given Weiss\\' location & name by a representative at the Rape Crisis Hotline. I drove to the ER at Weiss, and spoke with nurses, police, and a doctor assigned to my case. A nurse had photocopied my insurance information & given it to the doctor. When he found out why I was there, he tore up the paper and threw it away, telling me, \"See? We won\\'t even keep this here.\" I spoke with a female police officer, who said that given the medical information provided, I had grounds for filing a police report, but that doing so would be a waste of time because the statute of limitations would run out before the state even got to my rape kit (since I don\\'t have a perpetrator\\'s name or DNA evidence), and that it would put me in \"the system\" as a rape victim. This dissuaded me from filing a report, and I simply waited for my STD test results & really, really wanted to go home. Upon being discharged from the ER, I was given customary paperwork, and something to mail to Lisa Madigan\\'s office. I received no instruction regarding this paper, but assumed it needed to be completed, and I completed it to the best of my ability with no police report, no perpetrator\\'s name, and no hospital bill (as I had been informed that ER services for rape examinations are of no cost to the patient, and I had received no bill, AND the doctor had torn up my insurance information). Therefore, I was not concerned when, in January, I received a letter from the Attorney General stating that my \"claim\" had been denied due to lack of police report (as noted, I had been informed BY police that this would be a \"waste of time\"). That claim denial was fine with me; I wasn\\'t really asking for any compensation; I filled out the paperwork because it was given to me and I thought it was mandatory. HOWEVER, today, nearly one year later, I received a bill for $430 for \"emergency room services\" from Weiss Hospital. I was dissuaded from filing a police report by a police officer at the hospital. No advocate from the rape crisis center met me at the ER as indicated over the phone when I called, and I received no communication whatsoever from Weiss, much less a BILL, until today. The Attorney General denied my \"claim\" (for good reason, given there was not even a dollar amount to claim until today), and the hospital is asking me not only to revisit this memory, but to pay $430 for my rape exam. It is my understanding that IL-DHS is to pay the hospital if a sexual assault exam \"claim\" is denied by the Attorney General, and the patient wishes to maintain confidentiality by not filing through insurance, OR does not have insurance. I cannot explain how horrible I feel. I\\'m trying not to get overly emotional, but I would have just gone to my own doctor and forfeited my confidentiality/insurance notification if I\\'d known this was going to cost me $430 and follow me over a year\\'s time. I also would have filed a police report if I\\'d been informed that it impacted my ER treatment costs, and if I hadn\\'t been told by the police officer that my rape kit would be a waste of time and humiliation, and that the kit would basically sit on a shelf \"downstate,\" and would \"not be examined before the statute of limitations is up.\" As a social worker and human rights advocate myself, I am outright disgusted with Weiss Hospital, and with the Chicago Police Department, for the manner in which this situation was handled. I will be addressing it legally first thing in the morning, and I hope this does not happen to other women (or men!) in the future.', 'I arrived at this emergency room short of breath. I was alone. I filled out a form with the following information..I am not a Kaiser Member, but was 20 years ago.First/last name, social security number, address, phone number, date of birthBonus points for the receptionist handing me off to the triage nurse right away for an EKG. This was the only real thing they got correct.Five minutes after the EKG, the nurse asked if I had a different last name. I said \"Yes, my married name from 20 years ago.\" They had me as my married name in their old records. I told them that my legal name had been changed in 1994. I explained that I was no longer married, and had not used that married name since 1994. I explained that all of my insurance paperwork is under my legal name, not my married name. They nodded, said they would change it. I was given a bracelet showing my married name as they \"could not change my last name as I was not a current member.\" I was asked what medications I was currently on, I told them. The triage nurse appeared to be typing them in, but they didn\\'t show up on my discharge paperwork. I was never asked about allergies nor was I asked to sign paperwork to authorize treatment before I was discharged. I was never asked for emergency contact information before I was discharged.   Think about the above paragraph. I entered a hospital emergency room with pressure on my chest, and short of breath. They admitted into the emergency room for treatment under a last name I have not used in 20 years. They had no updated emergency contact information for me. They did not have recent allergic information.    If I had died, they would not have been able to locate my family other than by going to my address. I didn\\'t even authorize the doctor to treat me by signature so they would have no proof I had consented to be treated. They would no doubt have filled out my death certificate in a non-legal name, which would have made a mess for my family trying to close out my estate. The doctor handed me a prescription in my married last name. A last name I haven\\'t used in 20 years. A last name that does not match my insurance card so filling the prescription would be out of pocket, not covered. For that matter, when they submit the insurance claim for the visit, they are going to submit it in my married last name. Which means it is not likely going to be covered. Which means a covered visit will be billed to me instead of being paid for insurance. I was asked at the time of discharge for my emergency contact information. I was asked to sign to authorize treatment at that time also. I stated it was a little late to ask for that \"now\" when I had already been treated. I was told that it was standard operating procedure to do it that way. Be warned folks, this hospital was efficient at treating my ailments, but the paperwork side left a lot to be desired. I am still fighting a week later to get them to update my records to reflect my correct last name. They appear unable to figure out who is in charge of doing that.', 'I had 5 different consultations with surgeons. All said my surgery should be done in 2 procedures, EXCEPT Dr. Leighton who assured me he could do it \"with perfection in 1\" Initially, it appeared to be a good experience, until issues occurred, then I was talked down to, was yelled at and was called \"a baby\" because I flew back early from a trip because my stitches opened up. I was sutured up in his office with just Novocain. I had a large hole in my breast due to skin that died and in the end my nipple died also. I am left with NO NIPPLE on one side and several plastic surgeons said that with all the scar tissue they CANT make it any better so I am left with the only option of having a tattoo for a nipple. Although plastic surgery is not a perfect science, Dr. Leighton should have been more upfront about what things could have occurred, had I known what I know now, I never would have gone in for the procedure. He was NOT upfront with me the entire time I was told that I would be fine.', \"I've always been an athletic and active person so maintaining that lifestyle while pregnant was a goal of mine. I notified my coaches immediately so they could help me to stay safe & smart. I was halfway through my pregnancy before Dr. Brown was recommended to me. I wasn't very happy at the large group practice I was at so I decided to make the switch. What a great decision that was! Having a doctor that understood exactly what I was doing was priceless. Having clear instruction on which movements were okay and which ones weren't made me feel much more confident in the gym. Also, not feeling shamed for being so active was very important. I had Dr. Brown's full support and encouragement to keep it up. Even though I felt pretty sick in the first trimester I was able to maintain my 5-6 days-a-week class schedule up until the day my water broke! I have to admit that it was kind of nice being able to workout everyday and not worry about being so competitive. I was just enjoying keeping my baby and myself healthy throughout the process. If something didn't feel good on a certain day I would listen to my body and change the movement or even cut the workout short if need be. I gained approximately 30lbs throughout the pregnancy and had a very healthy 6lb 11oz baby girl at 39 weeks. My labor was about 15 hours and my body held up great. The nurses were impressed with how low my heart rate stayed throughout my contractions. When it came time to push it probably took less than 10 minutes! My recovery time was quick too. I was back in the gym after I got the okay from Dr. Brown at 4 weeks with a few limitations. I actually hit my pre-pregnancy weight even before that! The extra weight just fell off and I know I have CrossFit to thank for that. I'm so thankful to have had a healthy full term pregnancy and a healthy and happy baby. I will definitely be doing the exact same thing for baby #2 someday!\", \"They barely gave me any information at all. I'm going to have to do my own research to get my questions answered. I would never send my friends or family to Dr. Heeter. He is an arrogant JERK. I wai ted once for 5 days for my blood pressure prescription to be filled it came to a head when I passed out in my sons driveway after 3 calls to Amber his nurse, my wife called and talked to the staff in the front office and within 15 minutes Dr. Engle called in a script for me. If it would had not been for the girls in the front who knows when it would have gottten done. My experience here was truly horrifying. The staff was very helpful no matter how many times I called with a question or concern. They never made me feel uncomfortable for asking any question. They were far to arrogant to get any sort of outside advice, even though they knew they should. I was hoping to see someone that considered my safety more important than always having an answer.\", 'Friends, there is a reason for either 5 stars, or only 1. I had both experiences with this doctor in a short period of time and I have decided to move on. If you can\\'t believe anyone could rate her only 1 star, then maybe you should read about their experiences, and don\\'t be surprised when it happens to you. First and second experience, 5 stars. Although my husband and I were absolutely devastated to find that our baby had no heartbeat at almost 12 weeks pregnant, and that I needed a D&C, Dr. Reimnitz was very compassionate and guided us through the whole process, calling to check up on me after the procedure.  Third experience, zero stars. Unbelievable. I went in for my one week follow up appointment post d&c, by myself since my husband had to work. I was put into a room with 3 full bulletin boards of cute newborn baby photos. Since I had just lost my baby it was really hard to look at all of those beaming faces, by myself, and not cry. When Dr. Reimnitz came into the room she looked at me and said \"How are you doing\". I said \"As well as I can I guess\" I had pretty much been crying for a week straight after losing my baby. She basically insinuated that it had been a week since the procedure, and that I should be feeling fine by now, not emotionally devastated like I was. She said that it just meant that I could be pregnant again soon and be seeing her again for OB care. She asked if I needed \"help\" as in psychiatric help, because obviously my mental state was not a normal reaction. She performed the exam and told me to come back for my annual, and to call her if I needed to \"see someone\". Really? One week after losing a baby that I had been carrying for almost 12 weeks I\\'m supposed to be just hunky-dorey? Like nothing ever happened? And, I\\'ll be able to get pregnant again after 2 weeks and come back to see her? Let me add that Dr. Reimnitz still had this attitude and false optimism with the knowledge that it had taken me 4 years to get pregnant, that I was 41 years old and had been through 10 fertility treatments. Miraculously this was a natural pregnancy and I was nearly 100% certain that this miracle wouldn\\'t happen again based on my age and experience. Guess what. It\\'s been one year, and I have not gotten pregnant again. Big surprise. The pregnancy loss was obviously not her fault. The condescending attitude, false, inappropriate optimism and cold hearted response to my agony over my loss just added to my grief.  From my own experience and reading the other reviews it seems that you\\'ll have a great experience with this doctor if you have a normal, uncomplicated pregnancy and she can happily deliver your baby. If you have questions, concerns, emotional pain from a pregnancy loss, or, as others have stated, you\\'re overweight, you can expect to be treated like less than a person.', 'Dr Gates was recommended by a coworker. He is knowledgeable, and will sit with you until every question is answered. Thought his staff was friendly and caring. Had to have surgery next door and his surgical staff was top notch. I cannot get over how great Dr Gates was. I was so scared but they really eased my fears and and every woman there had a procedure done by dr gates. And every male I asked said he was the best they\\'ve ever worked with. Wish he was my doctor for everything! Had to update this to discuss just how bad gates\\' nurse practitioner Gail Ehlin was. Terrible Bedside Manner. Infections from surgeries happen Often enough. I had to go to the er because I had some sort of infection about a week after the surgery. She told me it \"looked like the flue or cold\" and whoever i went to see about that shouldn\\'t \"pass the buck\" back to her/her office. I was floored. Worst bedside manner. Worst sense of accountability to even see what the problem could be especially since I had surgery there a week ago. Needless to say she was wrong. I had an infection from the urinary catheter that was put in and it spread through my blood. As soon as my general Doctor (who could tell in about 10 min) gave me scrips for this I felt immediately better after the first dose. Dr Gates was awesome. But I hope I never need to deal with Gail again. I took off 1 star because of the experience with her. I\\'d give her 0 stars but gates was way too good for me to do that.', 'This rating is just for the Kaiser \"On The Job\" occupational health services.

For example, my Vit D was way too low. When it went up to 86. She said that was good. I said, but can\\'t it get too high. She said, oh yeah. And THEN she lowered my dosage. Similar result with Cholesterol. The final straw was when I was having many problems and she kept bringing me in for followups but had no suggestions. I diagnosed myself. When I complained that I was going to find another doctor she \"fired\" me first LOL. She told me I was a \"hard\" patient. I said I have only 2 things wrong. My medical history is nothing compared to other patients. I am writing this now because I just got a letter (3 months after I terminated) telling me again she is terminating me as a patient. Of course she postdated the letter to match. She had backdated a referral by 7 months to be able to say she made a correct referral. Not someone I would recommend.', 'I was a patient of Dr. Pearson for many years as an adolescent. I would STRONGLY recommend staying away from her. As a child, I did not realize the severity of how she practiced, however now that I am an adult, I still recall strong memories of how she pushed the limits of malpractice. I encountered a traumatic event at a young age and experienced depression for many years. After receiving cognitive therapy for many years, the therapist recommended that I see a psychiatrist to help aid in the treatment of my depression. Within 3 years of seeing Dr. Pearson, she prescribed me over 30 different medications to treat over 5 disorders that never existed to begin with! She diagnosed me with ADHD, Bipolar, Dissociative disorders, and even went as far to get me treated for schizophrenia. A child has no control over these things and it was wrong of her to tell my guardian that these things were what was needed. I was questioned at school by administration due to my \"zombie-like\" appearance, and even got in trouble because I could not stand for the pledge after starting a medication for schizophrenia the night before. My doses were way too high, and at one point, I was taking 10 different medications and a total of 18 pills per day for \"psychiatric\" issues. Today, I am a straight A college student, who never encounters the signs of any of these false diagnosis. I have not taken medication for over 5 years for psychiatric issues, and as I learn more in the field of psychology, I know better than to believe for one second that Dr. Pearson had any good intentions towards me or any other patient. I pray that people do their research before choosing any doctor and that even if this review helps one person prevent becoming a victim of Dr. Pearson, then my time is well spent.', 'Hello Kaiser Ontario, I have been a very satisfied and thankful member of Kaiser for many years because you are the best and every representative also shows great class and courtesy and true concern to help to little details. Many times I have purchased a little something from your gift stores for family or friends in your care Each time it was a heartfelt experience with your attendant when my order was taken and the love was shared to those who were in need of a little comfort. Except this time, I called the Ontario Store and that is where the bad experience started but I went along with the purchase and schedule for delivery. I even told my wife today the day after when we passed the store to visit our loved one, about the total lack of compassion. Sure enough the little monkey and balloon I purchased was dropped off with no card as to who it was for or where it came from. No one knew anything just saying someone came in and left it. I would like to bring to your attention, your gift store attendant displayed shallow indifference. To me a gift store is a collection of feelings that are shared for a many variety of emotional needs and it could be handled with this in mind. thank you', 'My 81 year old grandmother recently broke her hip and required emergency services at Hayward Kaiser. She went to emergency Sunday morning and was advised by the doctor in the late afternoon that she had broken her hip.We waited and waited for the doctor to give us an update but it was like pulling teeth. They said she will need surgery and they were going to do it that day however they did not perform the surgery till late afternoon the next day.The doctors and nurses never kept us informed of what the plan was and so we had to keep asking them consistently. The next day after her surgery I came and visited in the early morning to see that there were BIG bruises on her left and right arms. I questioned the nurse and she told me oh it was because of the IV\\'s that were put in her. I have included pictures in this Yelp review and you tell me do the bruises appear to be caused by an IV? I certainly don\\'t think so. I spoke to the charge nurse and the nurse manger and they said they will investigate however I have not heard anything back and it has been a few days already. The days following the recovery my grandmother complained about the nurses not being receptive to her needs. They neglected to offer her something to eat at night, did not help her reposition herself in bed and mishandled her. My family members take shifts during the day and evening the to spend time with her but at night my grandmother is there alone and that\\'s when the nurses neglect her because none of us are around to keep an eye out. Today I went to check on her and they were all wearing mask to protect themselves and I was thinking to myself now why are they all wearing a mask. Her nurse even came into the room and did her thing and never mentioned to us that we needed a mask. Another nurse for another patient came into the room and said \"should you be wearing a mask\"? By that point I was PISSED. My grandmothers nurse did not even notify us that we should be wearing a mask. Apparently my grandmother might have TB and so anyone who comes in contact with her must wear a mask. I demanded to speak to the manger or a patient representative to address the issue of not informing the family members of the precaution. The charge nurse came to speak to us and agreed the nurse should of advised us that we needed a mask. So now my mom and I have been exposed to TB. Kaiser does not have a patient representative on site to address complaints but they give you the general Kaiser number to call and your suppose navigate through it to find someone to complaint to. By this point I am outraged by the dismal performance of the hospitals nursing staff. By far this is the worse Hospital I have been to. If my grandmother was not on HMO I\\'d take her out of her so fast because who wants their grandmother to suffer with health care professionals that disregard to their patients!', \"My son had an infection in his eye and when we took him I had other concerns that I notice with his eye I had to point them out to him and he seamed bothered and tried to rush me out, as a worry & concern mother I did not let him rush me I told him if he can look closer. I notice one of my sons eye turning in and he said oh that's normal because of his nose but we never notice it until the infection and he again tried to get rid of us so I asked again please look at his eye and then he came back from a distance told us oh yeah he needs glasses and gave us a prescription that was not accurate it seamed like he just guessed instead of looking close. He had a bad attitude since we didn't let him rush us and he made my 2 year old very nervous and told my husband if you can keep him quiet we would need to reschedule the appointment never was he nice or even tried to make my son comfortable very rude I would not recomend him nor will I ever go back to him, we chosed him in the begging because we where told he was knowledgeable but after our visit we notice he has no patience or cared for his patients needs or concerns, to us its seamed as if we question him or had question he was bother because we were taking longer then he wanted to spend with us.

This is the first time I have ever written in response to a doctor visit thats how bad he is. I am actually thinking of complaining to the medical association.', 'I have a severe deviated septum that is to this day only more exasperated and not any better thanks to Dr. Lubka. I was referred to Kaiser\\'s \"best\" ENT doctor in 2006 to correct my septum and thus allow me to finally breath through my nose regularly and not get asthmatic when trying to sustain a high heart rate due to poor air intake. I had such high hopes after my initial consultation with Lubka. She sounded completely confident, if not a little overbearing, in her assessment and general diagnosis for approaching a corrective surgery strategy to which I should have paid much more heed to. To my utter dismay and horror, I came out with having had an experimental procedure of my nostrils being cut, widened, and flipped to theoretically allow more air flow, along with much \"scrapping\" inside the passages. HOWEVER, my septum, the bone structure that is detrimentally deviated, remained unaltered...no attempt to straighten was attempted! In addition, she unbelievably botched up the routine stitches that were importantly reattaching my nostrils to my face! During recovery, there was a major gap in my right nostril where it met the skin that I immediately made an appointment and drove the hour and half to Kaiser\\'s elite LA hospital where Lubka only worked to address. I specifically told her and showed her my many concerns that were already visually apparent with the stitching, as well as the uneven nostril alignment reattachment, and she said that my skin would heal together right on its own over her \"handy work\" and that she was trying to balance my two sides of the face better by noticeably raising my left side so it would look more symmetrical. Suffice to say, five years later, my breathing is more congested due to the inflammation around the nostrils and inside my nasal passages and my deviated septum left unfixed. My nose has very apparent and terrible looking scar tissue that is not even in a decent line, with that indented section on the right side, or as my husband says, the gapping hole. Lets not get started on the askew placement of the nostrils that has thrown off my entire features and not balanced anything. The extensive trauma to the nostrils constantly hurts and itches and I am left still trying to save for a reputable, skilled, and practiced plastic surgeon to actually FIX my deviation and now my horrible looking nose that has definitely wounded my self confidence from the perspective of a wife and wanting to take any pictures. I cannot stress enough how much I regret having Dr. Lubka even get near my nose, let alone attempt surgery on it. I should have sought out a true professional and sacrificed out of pocket to avoid a world of hurt and disappointment to then only have her tell me post-op that my family, friends, and I were all being vainly critical and my \"phantom pain\" would go away and breathing increase as time went on. She was short, defensive, unwilling to discuss, and critical for her shortcomings. Her true colors came out to late for me, but hopefully this heartfelt review can spare another!\\\\[]', \"Dr. Lonnie Paulos performed an ACL knee surgery on me from a skiing accident.

In every aspect of the pre-surgery, surgery and the post-surgery I have been 100 percent satisfied with the skill Dr. Paulos operated and the outcome. He is the best orthopedic surgeon in this Country. I have healed properly and I'm active in many sports in my 50ies. I run into people all the time that tell me they are suffering from knee operations. My first question is always, who was your Doctor? My thoughts when they tell me about their doctor is normally the same; why didn't they chose Dr. Paulos and be where I'm at today. I'm Active and healthy after knee surgery! I truly think he made the difference from what kind of lifestyle I'm living today. Thanks Dr. Paulos for giving me my active life back again!\", 'Since they have been bought out by a new company they are not what they use to be. I went to this hospital in February for numbness on my left side of my body. I thought I had, had a stroke. However they did tests and said that I had hyperkalemia and to go home and to stay away from high potassium foods. So I did what they said and still ended up back there the next day feeling worse. When I went back they did nothing but give me a bag of saline through IV and send me home. When I went to the registration counter to give them my address information I was told that this is the ER and only for emergency use. And that because I did not have insurance I should not use them I should use free clinics instead. I thought I had an emergency because I was numb on one side of my body. They have the rudest doctors and staff I have ever encountered and would not recommend this place unless you have a heart attack and then I would only recommend them because they have a center developed just for this problem.', \"First of all let me say that I never write reviews BUT they are the first thing I search for when looking for a provider or service. So, I wanted to share my recent experience for those who are like me and look for reviews prior to scheduling. I made an appointment for my 4 year old son and I admit I was a little hesistant to do so after reading a few of the reviews about the wait time. However since he was highly recommended from a friend who took her toddler there, I went ahead and scheduled and I'M SO GLAD I DID! Dr Roan and his entire staff has been so nice, especially his Medical Assistant Kim! From the moment you enter, the office is very inviting for both kids and adults. There is a children's section with toys and an animated movie playing. For adults without kids who want to want to be somewhat away from there, the waiting area is large enough and have chairs to where you can relax away from the kids area. The front desk staff greeting me with a smile and never appeared rude. THE WAIT TIME WAS NOT LONG AT ALL! I maybe waited 20 minutes in the lobby and about 15 minutes in the exam room. Dr Rohn is nothing short of AMAZING! Upon entry to the exam room, he engaged with my child, smiled, and made my child at ease. He took his time to examine and explain everything to me and answer any questions that I may have had (and I had questions). I never felt rush and came away feeling that he truly cared and was knowledgeable in his profession. He ensured I understood before completing the visit. So after the visit, we had some next steps and that's where Kim comes in! Kim, his medical assistant is so patient and nice! I have had several follow up conversations with her (as we prepare for my son's procedure). The times when I've left her a message, she follows up within hours of the same day. One time, I even apologized for reaching out so much, but she was always welcoming and said she understood. I'm still interacting with him and him wonderful staff but wanted to take this time do a review from my visit and interaction with this week. I HIGHLY recommend if you are looking for a trusting place you can take your child (or yourself) that will give you accurate diagnosis and an overall great experience!

I went to him because I thought I had 2 lipomas (small fatty tumor under the skin) one on my back and on on my abdomen. He looked at them and then scheduled me for surgery. He did not tell me he thought anything was suspicious. When I was waking up from my anesthesia he told me he thought I had cancer (a sarcoma). I was floored. During my post operative appointment he told me I had to have surgery again as soon as possible to get a margin around the tumor. I asked him if he thought I had cancer before he cut me open and he says YES! I was so angry that not only did he not feel the need to tell me this, but he did not do a biopsy or scans. Thus resulting in two surgeries. I have no had a recurrence and upon further research into my specific rare tumor, found that he never should have cut me open in the first place. I am generally a very calm and forgiving person but this is something I am having significant trouble getting over. I now have mesh in my abdomen that causes me pain every day. And it NEVER should have been there. Be ware of this doctor. He has a great bedside manner and is wonderful to talk to but he is not giving the best care and I regret ever having interacted with him.', 'I was blessed enough to be able to be seen by Dr. Jabara! My husband and I have more than a year trying to get pregnant, we tried several options before we finally decided to see a specialist, from there we were referred to Dr. Jabara and he has been a blessing in our lives! I was able to get pregnant after 3 months and was more than elated! Visits to his office required driving all the way to Hollywood but I would do it again if I had to because the end result was so worth it! I am now 6 months and expecting my first baby boy thanks to this wonderful man! His staff was also very attentive during visits, there was always someone offering me a magazine or a glass of water- these people truly know how to be compassionate under such stressful circumstances. Dr. Jabara was always checking up on me and was quick and efficient, I have never seen a doctor come out to get the patients from the lobby himself! His work ethic made us feel like we were in the right hands and we are glad we put our trust in him! Mil gracias Doctor Jabara!', 'I have been seeing Dr. Bierman for six years. He, his assistant and the rest of the office staff have always been very pleasant. I have continued to go to him because I had no ongoing issues, and all I needed was medication refills--although I nicknamed him \"Dr. Worthless\" years ago. Now, I have some medical issues, and I am afraid to trust him. Some of the reasons why: 1. All my annual screenings are years behind. When I told him my insurance company wanted to know why I hadn\\'t had the tests that would be fully paid for, he badmouthed the insurance company. 2. He spends most of his time on the computer. He has never examined me, ever. 3. When I told him a generic of my medication caused problems, he never asked what. He just wrote a prescription for the name brand. 4. At EVERY appointment, he comments on how old I am. Last appointment, he asked how long my parents had lived so he could calculate how much longer I would be around. (I am in my 70\\'s and very active.) 5. He could not concentrate at my last appointment. I had to repeat several times what medications I wanted refilled. There is more, but you get the idea. I am looking for another PCP, but after reading dozens of reviews, I am not sure it gets any better.', 'My husband took me to North Fulton for severe pain I was having. We were trying to make it to Northside and looking back I wish I could have stuck out the pain. To begin, I was mixed up with another patient, drew blood and hooked me up to iv fluid and said results would be back in half an hour. The nurse came in twice the entire 8 hour long visit. During my visit the nurses and security stood/sat around on the desk, flirting, talking about xbox, complaining about work, etc. The only time anyone came in was to ask who my pcp was and to restock shelves, both were very unprofessional and rude.After 7 hours of waiting to hear what was going on and having severe dry mouth I called for a glass of water. I could hear the nurses at the desk complaining about who was going to get me water. After half an hour a nurse brought me water and I asked her if there was any word yet on the lab work. She told me \"that wasnt her job and she was doing me a favor.\" My husband said to her we had been here a long time and hadnt heard anything yet. She became hostile and yelled at my husband infront of my son which woke him up and made him cry and just kept saying she was doing me a favor and stormed out. Shortly after this, Dr. Bharara came in and was very short telling me I could leave if I wanted. I asked what the results where and she said they were still waiting to hear from my pcp... at almost midnight. She said I may or may not have a kidney stone and my kidney was swollen but it may or may not be from fluid. After being treated rudely, and still feeling aweful I decided to go. To top off the atrocious care, the paperwork they gave me was for a uti diagnosis which was never addressed and an antibiotic. My husband decided to take me to Northside, our original plan, where the staff was much more professional and attentative. Turns out I was severly dehydrated and had a kidney stone. Do not understand why Dr. Bharara wasnt able to make that diagnosis and was relying on my pcp.', 'My husband took me to North Fulton for severe pain I was having.

She spoke very highly of him and the quality of his work, so I thought I would go check him out. I\\'ve been in the market for a breast reduction for years, so I\\'ve visited many doctors trying to find the best fit. Right when I met Dr. Perez I knew I wanted him to be my surgeon. He was very nice and knowledgeable. He had such a contagious energy about him.. You just want to hug the man every time you see him. \\n\\nRight when I walked in, I was greeted by his friendly staff. They made me feel so comfortable throughout the whole process. During the consultation, he sat down with me and gave me a detailed rundown of the surgery and everything I could expect afterwards. He spent a good amount of time showing me before and after pictures of previous patients and answering all my questions.\\n\\nI was so excited after the consultation, I wanted to sign the paperwork on the spot and schedule my surgery. Instead, he told me to go home and think about it.. to make sure this was something I really wanted. Something about that moment was a huge relief. This guy was not interested in taking my money and running. He wanted to make sure this was the best thing for me. I liked that. \\n\\nI\\'m 5\\'10 and I had DD breasts before my surgery. I wanted them reduced to a B cup, but every doctor I spoke to before told me that wasn\\'t a good idea since I am so tall. They lectured me on how it would look disproportionate compared to the rest of my body and that it wasn\\'t a smart decision. To me, this wasn\\'t about proportion.. it was about convenience. I\\'m athletic and I\\'m always moving around. My breasts kept me from doing so many things that I loved. They caused major back pain, not to mention insecurities.\\n\\nI went to Dr. Perez and I told him how I wanted them smaller than what other doctors deemed normal or appropriate for my size. He listened to everything I had to say and he told me his thoughts. He talked to me about proportion and wanted to make sure I understood everything before I made my decision. I told him I was sure, and he said \"okay\" with a smile on his face. No lectures, no nothing.\\n\\nHe made thorough notes on everything I wanted so that he could refer back to it the day of surgery. He also wanted me to tell everyone that would be in the surgery room my requests as well, so that everyone will be on the same page.  The morning of surgery, I did exactly what he said.. From the anesthesiologist to the nurse that prepped me, everyone knew what I wanted.\\n\\nI\\'m 3 weeks post op and I\\'m so amazed with the results. I have the small, perky boobs I\\'ve always wanted! They are seriously perfect and they look proportionate to the rest of my body, which is awesome! I\\'m so glad I chose Dr. Perez to perform my surgery. He gave me exactly what I wanted and I couldn\\'t be happier.\\n\\nI would recommend this doctor to anyone looking for a quality plastic surgeon in the Tampa Bay area. He seriously is the best.\\n\\n', \"I've heard not so positive things about Weiss, before I was prescribed rehabilitation here. I came here not knowing what to expect, in terms of customer service, but I am exited to say that Vivian, my therapist and her coworkers, have made each visit here memorable. Vivian pushed me as far she could all while doing everything she could to make me feel comfortable. She did this by reminding me, ever time I felt like giving up, that there would be a time in my future were I would carry my children and take part in my leisure actives. Her words gave me the strength to work harder. She was flexible with time, I had to travel one and a half hours from my school to wise, sometimes longer but, Vivian waited for me. She never turned me down, instead she would think of new ways to work around my busy schedule. She celebrated my progress with me, that was something I would never forget. More over the out patient therapy works hard to make sure that their patients are comfortable. A great example of this is when they offer coffee or hot chocolate, my favorite, this to me was priceless because, there were times when I came in soaking wet from freezing rain or freezing because of the cold weather outside. The hot chocolate helped me settle down. Vivian would offer towels for me to dry myself. I'm so grateful for everything she's done for me. I still can't believe I'm graduating from therapy. I honestly would not have made it through my first semester of college without the therapy I received here at Weiss. Thank you guys for everything that you do. Respectively yours, Marie Soudy\", 'My family has a history of skin cancer and when my husband spotted a mole on my shoulder that was changing; I started to freak out. I called a couple of dermatologist in the area and could not get in for months. When reading the paper over the weekend I saw a ad for a FREE skin cancer screening in Amherst Ohio. I could not believe my luck but felt like it might be some kind of gimmick. I called on Monday and a very nice lady told\\r\\nme Dr Mirando does these type of screenings 3 times a year. She took my name and number, told me to have a get day and see you Tuesday. When I arrived at the office, my mind went right back to thinking this was a gimmickthe waiting room was full!!!\\r\\nI filled out my paper work and just kept thinking this was a waste of my time. In about\\r\\n20 minutes a very friendly nurse called me back to an exam room; she asked a few questions then asked if I had any concerns. Before I could answer her, Dr Mirando came into the room.He thanked me for coming in today and asked if I had any spots that I wanted looked at. He made some small talk while he looked at my back, and then told me\\r\\nthat he saw 2 spots (not one) that needed attention. He told me to make an appointment and they would see me in a couple of weeks. Again, he thanked me for coming in and left the room. The nurse went over some papers with me and told me not to forget to make the appointment. T o my surprise, everything went pretty quick and I was able to make an appointment within 2 weeks. At my next appointment, I was greeted by a different nurse who was also very nice. She could see that I was nervous and told me that everything would be fine. Dr. Mirando (Bill) entered the room and could also tell that I was nervous about this procedure. He started to joke around with me and before I knew it he was doing the procedure. He stitched me up, told me the nurse would go over the instructions to care for the wound, and they would have the lab results in a week or two. As he was leaving he thanked me again for coming in said God Bless and walked out. Wow, he was very quick and to the point but I felt comfortable during the whole procedure.\\r\\nSo, within the time it would have taken to get an appointment else where: I was able to have 2 procedures done ( both spots came back as precancerous) and follow up appointments to insure me they got all the bad cells and that I was fine. \\r\\nWhat a great doctor! He not only cares about the well being of his patients but he is giving people in the area a way to get a free skin cancer checkup. \\r\\nDr Mirando (Bill) if you read this, I wanted to thank you for the wonderful care and to let you know that I tell everyone I know what a great person you really are.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you,\\r\\nJNH\\r\\nGod Bless', 'I went in as a new patient for my annual exam because I am new to the area. The nice thing was that I was able to get an appointment quickly and the doctor was able to see me the following week. Everyone at the office was nice, but the doctor gave me about 2 minutes of her time to do my exam and left the room. She never asked a question about my medical history, did not see if I had any questions (which I did because I was curious about changing my normal prescription) and did not have the discussion a OBGYN should be having with patients when they go visit a doctor once a year. I was shocked the doctor did not take the time to talk to me at all and rushed through the exam. The point of me getting the exam was so I can get a refill of my prescription. 2 weeks after my exam I did not hear anything and still had not receive my prescription. I called the doctor\\'s office to see why nothing had been sent and they instantly blamed it on the pharmacy. Later they realized they made a mistake but tried to cover it up saying I was supposed to send it in (I specifically asked them if everything was done before I left the doctor\\'s office that day to make sure I did not need to send in the prescription myself). I provided them a new pharmacy location near me to send in the prescription so I could pick it up. It has now been a week and I go to my pharmacy today to only be told nothing STILL has been sent in. Above everything, no one from the office called me with my exam results. When I called in to get my results, the receptionist said \"No news is good news\". I think if you are taking an exam, you have a right to have someone call you and tell you your results as they said they do. Dr. Aronson seemed nice but I will be finding another doctor for the future.', \"Dr. Braswell is laid back and funny. Those are the pros. However, office visits require long waits. I've never been there and waited less than 45 mins... I don't think I've ever waited less than an hour. That's JUST for vitals. After vitals you go back to the waiting room and wait some more. Finally, you're put in a room where you, again, wait some more. At LEAST another 30-45 minutes. I switched to Dr Braswell during the last two or so months of my pregnancy because I wanted a doctor who I could get comfortable with. Where I was before rotated doctors and so there was no guarantee as to who would deliver me. I expressed this concern. However, I soon learned there was no reassurance at Dr Braswell's office either. My first experience at her office was that I got there and was told that she was out on delivery. I waited several hours for her to get back . My second experience was that she was on vacation and I was being seen by the PA. There was another occasion where I came in and was told that my appointment needed to be rescheduled because she was out doing a delivery. However my question is why didn't the office staff call me before I left work early and came all the way to the office? The times I did actually see Dr Braswell she was pleasant enough but always seems to be in a hurry. She would answer questions but it always felt like she was answering them with one foot out out the door. Sometimes she literally was walking toward the door while answering. Not to mention one time when she gave me results from a test they did and seemed to blaze over them while verbally implying that I already knew them. How would I have? I even had to be the one to ask about the results. Had I not I wouldn't have found out important info about my pregnancy. I had to ask about everything. How was my urine sample? How is my bp? Where I transferred from they told me everything they were doing and so that's what I was used to. I think Dr. Braswell is too busy. Part of this could also be because the office only seems to open Monday through Thursday. Is this the norm for private practices? Doesn't seem normal to close every Friday and for the one Doctor to be off every weekend. Needless to say, I still ended up being delivered by a perfect stranger. This being my 1st pregnancy, it was important that I felt comfortable but I didn't. As far as current experiences. I contacted Dr Braswell's office on several occasions because I had a concern & question about some post delivery symptoms I was still having and wanted to verify if it was a true concern. Again I felt as if she was way too busy to give me proper attention. The receptionist also made it seem as if my call didn't deserve a direct conversation with Dr. Braswell, all of which would have taken 3 minutes. It appears that once you deliver you are no longer a concern. After several times calling and excuses from the receptionists, I still have yet to receive a call back. I just gave up. All of these perfect reviews that she's getting, I'm not buying. If I were to base my review only on personality then, yes, Dr Braswell would get 5 stars. But at the end of the day, I rather have a snob who at least took good care of me and ensured that everything went well pre and post delivery.\", \"This was my first dermatologists appointment in my life. This is also the first review I've written for a doctor. After waiting 1 hour and 45 minutes for my first appointment I only saw Dr. Norman on my way out after I was diagnosed with some pre-cancers. I only dealt with his Physician Assistant. They did a whole body diagnosis of my skin looking for any abnormalities. Other than pre-cancers on my face and one small basil cell cancer to be removed from my face that is all they found. Going back to the office for removal of the basil cell cancer again I did not see Dr. Norman but the Physician Assistant who also did the surgery to remove the cancer. He seemed skilled and attentive. I went on line to one time to see if there were any reviews written on Dr. Norman and found quite a few negative so the following year I went to a different doctor just to see if there was a difference in how I was diagnosed and treated. To my great surprise there was a huge difference.After completing the paperwork in the office it was less than 5 minutes before I was asked to come back. Another 5 minutes and I was in front of a doctor who spent nearly 1 hour with me in a complete head to toe diagnosis of my skin. The diagnosis was so much more thorough than Dr. Normans office. Also they found three moles that were abnormal in nature which have been on my body for a few years. Dr. Norman never looked at my feet or through my hair line. This new doctor did and they found one of those moles on the top of my feet.Now, I'm dealing with receiving a letter from a collection company pursuing me for a bill in which I never received. You would think that Dr. Norman would at least call me to ask if I had received the bill and ask why I wasn't paying it. Instead they turned it over for collection. This goes to show me how out of touch Dr. Norman is with his business.\", \"This was my first dermatologists appointment in my life. This is also the first review I've written for a doctor.

I had a VERY disturbing experience with Mr. Warren Miller from Billing. Basically, I was on a conference call with my insurance company, and him, trying to figure out why my claim kept getting rejected. The insurance company told him he was using the incorrect ID# since I had changed insurance companies and he was using the new one and not the old one. He didn\\'t know I was on the line and said \"patients are so DUMB, they don\\'t tell you these things!\" I was shocked! I told him I was on the line and I had called last month about the same issue and HE told me it was fine and not to worry about the bill and he was going to reprocess it. I told him he was the dumb one not me. I have been on top of this and all of my medical bills from day 1 of my pregnancy. After the issue was resolved between my insurance company and him, I asked to speak to his office manager, Barbara. He, of course, sent me to her VM where I left my information for her to call me back. This happened today. I have not heard back from her or anyone from the office. I am sure Mr. Warren Miller was very embarrassed. He did apologize to me by saying \"sorry, I did not know you were on the line\" but that is definitely not they way to go. As a patient, we don\\'t fully understand everything to do with medical billing, that is why they are there to help us, we\\'d hope. Instead, they point fingers and blame it on you or the insurance company. I did my due diligence and contacted their billing department to make sure THEY get paid and this gets resolved. I had even called last month about this same issue and explained my situation to them. So sad to see that as a patient we do what we need to do and contact them for help and assistance and they turn around and call us dumb and offer no help at all. Mr. Warren Miller was rude from the start but I just brushed it off and assumed he was helping me as best he could. The truth was he was never even listening to what I had to say and pointed the finger at the insurance company. At the end, HE was the one using the wrong information to process the claim and now HE has to reprocess the paperwork. I am no longer a patient of this practice but I have been dealing with this since July 2015 (it is now almost November). You can have good doctors, but if your office workers treat your patients like this, they will not only be unhappy but they will leave and not recommend you to others.', 'I\\'ll try to keep this short, as I could most definitely write a novella about all the crap I went through to get a freaking birth control Rx. Basically, going to Dr. Vyas was a horrible experience. It should have been simple. Make an appointment, get my lady exam, get my Rx. She would run the tests, and call me if anything came back abnormal. That is how it has gone with every other doctor I have had. But, my old doctor is gone now, so I needed a new one, so I tried this doctor who is two blocks from my work. I have since learned my lesson about convenience. I would rather travel 20 miles to go to a quality doctor.My first appointment was at 10:30. I didn\\'t get called back by the nurse until 11:20. I didn\\'t see the doctor until 12:30. I got back to work at 1:00 and I was pissed. During the first meeting with her, she gave me TONS of shit about my weight (yes, I know I need to lose weight, but i\\'m not sure what that has to do with my lady exam), she second guessed every answer I gave her in regards to anything she asked (Do you have itching? No. Really? No itching? No. Hmmm.\"), she was a total smartass (Does your family have high blood pressure? I don\\'t know. Why don\\'t you know? Are you adopted??). She also went into a place that I don\\'t even let my boyfriend go, with NO warning, and when I yelped out in pain she said, \"Well, that is why you shouldn\\'t tense up.\" WTF?? At the end of that visit, she told me that she needed to draw blood and I needed to come back on Monday for an ultrasound \"because it is good to have one once in awhile.\" Huh? I have never heard of that, but okay. Oh yeah, and she wouldn\\'t give me birth control until she had all the test results back. I told her I needed it now, she said, \"You have time.\" I told her I have about seven days, and she said that I would have some before then.I went on Monday for the ultrasound, and again, was there for two hours. She told me I needed to drink 32oz of water an hour before I went. I was dying in the waiting room, I was about to burst. I finally got called back by the ultrasound lady, who was VERY nice. Why isn\\'t she the doctor? She started the exam and noticed how full my bladder was and told me I didn\\'t need to drink that much, just one glass of water would have sufficed. Thanks again, Dr. Vyas. I asked the lady what she was looking for. She said I was having the ultrasound because of the \"pain\" I had complained about. I never complained, or even mentioned pain. Way to make more money, Dr. Vyas.I went to my final appointment on Friday. I was there for another two hours. She finally came in the room and again gave me TONS of crap about my weight, like I was supposed to lose 40 pounds in five days. She obviously has her mind made up about me, without even asking me anything, because she was telling me I need to cut down on junk food, and stop drinking so much. Um...I never eat junk food and I drink wine, on weekends only. She started going over my test results. \"Your HPV test game back negative - that\\'s surprising!\" I looked at her with a WTF look and she said, \"Well, you have had so many partners. You really got lucky.\" OMG! I could go on and on about all the rude, bitchy, unprofessional comments she made to me. But, I will sum it up with this. After spending $40 in co-pays, wasting six hours in her office, and putting up with her attitude, I only got three months of birth control. In order for her to give me a year, she wants me to come back in six weeks for two more appointments (another $40 and four hours) so she can run more tests on me. No thanks! I will be going to Planned Parenthood, which is what I should have done in the first place, and I will get a full year of birth control, for free.', \"I brought my son in for a rash and it took Dr. Milici less than 60 seconds to identify the problem. Two interns where also present; whom I allowed to be in the room. I spent maybe a full 15 minutes in the room; I did take the opportunity to ask about what their protocal was on immunizations because I am currently expecting my second child and was planning on Dr. Milici seeing him as well. Turns out when I got my bill they charged me an extra $90 for a lengthy visit! This is outrageous! I spent more time waiting on her than I did seeing her; they never even told me after the visit. I told my OBGYN about this and she said that is ridiculous. Needless to say I am not going to be priced gouged by the doctor. I wouldn't go here if you want honest pricing.\", 'Although Viera Hospital touts a 3 minute ER waiting time, we waited in the ER patient room for 6 hours. We were told there was one doctor working. As it turns out my daughter tore her ACL in her knee, not dislocated her kneecap as the ER doctor implied. The ER staff X-rayed it, which did not diagnose the problem and did no further tests. Further, if you want your physician to have access to your ER record our report and they are not a Health First physician, you must go to the hospital to pick up your records. Just what I want to do as I am preparing my daughter for surgery, which will not be at a Health First location. I thought I would give Viera hospital a chance, since it is new and all, but I should have went to Wuesthoff; from now on I will.', \"I had been experiencing pain in my wrist and hand and felt very overwhelmed and lost as far as who I should go see. A friend told me I should go see Dr. Timothy Miller at KSF Orthopaedic Center, and I'm grateful I did. I could tell that my issue was important to him. He explained the treatment plan thoroughly and, from the first appointment, I felt very confident he would resolve the issue with my hand. He had discussed with me the plan of giving steroid shots, and if my hand didn't improve with the shots, I would need surgery. The steroid shots did help a little, but I was still having some pain so Dr. Miller suggested surgery. I agreed. The surgical experience could not have been better, and my pain is very minimal now, and will continue to improve with time. I love how KSF has a Physical Therapy center. I was sent for PT after surgery to ensure I gain my full range of motion back. I am writing this review in appreciation of the excellent care I received from Dr. Timothy Miller and his staff.\", \"I was a walk-in and was told the wait would be about an hour because they had appointments booked. They said after 4:30 they did not have appointments and so it varied how busy it was. So I decided to wait. To my great surprise I was seen in about 25 minutes after filling out paperwork. The front desk was very nice. The doctors assistant took me in, she was very nice and took the blood pressure etc. and told me the doctor would be in to see me shortly. Normally you wait forever, but not this time, the doctor came in right away. But the best part is yet to come. I have been to a few doctors in my life some of them very good, but Dr. Panitch was beyond exceptional. She fits into the top 1%. Not only did she listen to what I had to say BUT unlike many doctors she engaged me (eye contact and actually paying attention to the conversation) rather than typing into a computer and saying ahha once in a while. Dr. Panitch took the time to explain what she was testing me for (I had an ear ache). She explained her findings in a way I could understand. The bottom line is this. If I need a doctor again she is the one. I'll be back without reservation. This is the type of care we all hope for when going to see a doctor. Super smart, caring, and articulate, PERFECT CARE! I'm still amazed. When I went to pay the bill, I was told at the window that Dr. Panitch had stayed a couple of hours longer than she was supposed to see walk-in patients like myself. Even more unbelievable. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\", \"Kaiser Cascade Park nearly ruined me today. Called in my request for monthly refill of morphine, and technician Diana hung up the phone with me & promptly forgot obviously, because I found out an hour prior to having to be to work not only were my meds not ready, they hadn't even put in the request from a week ago! Told me there was nothing I could do, have to wait till my Dr. returns on Monday. Yeah right! Just stop taking 410mg of morphine for 3 days. Every few years they pull this on me, where I've done everything I am supposed to do, and because of their mistake I am SOL. So I had to have a family friend write me out an RX for enough pills to last me till Monday, which cost me $50. Otherwise I would've had to go to ER/Urgent care and would've been unable to make work on time, meaning the elderly bedridden stroke patient I care for would have to be left alone, which was not an option. So I would have been withdrawing from morphine tonight at work had it not been for a friend. Simply put, Kaiser pharmacy tech Leann did not care about my dilemma today at all. I did not deserve this, I do what I'm told for 16 yrs of taking these meds, and never know when someone will mess up. VERY upset at Kaiser pharmacy for leaving me hanging today.

       "  \"My 21-year-old daughter just returned from a visit with this doctor hysterical and in tears. Two weeks prior, she had returned from college with a cold she came down with during finals week, which turned worse during a post-grad week at the beaches in Maryland. Since she was going to be flying to Europe in a week and the cold was now 14-days old and producing green, bloody mucus, I advised her to visit the walk-in medi-center on Route 88 in Brick and tell the doctor her history so she could be evaluated for a bacterial infection and prescribed an antibiotic before heading oversees. When she came back, however, she was crying and extremely upset. She said the doctor had berated and belittled her because she told him she did not suffer from seasonal allergies. He kept insisting to her that she, in fact, did suffer from allergies and that she had better start taking Claritan in the fall. When my daughter again tried to explain that she had never suffered from seasonal allergies, he kept on belittling her to the point of tears. She told me she was so upset that she could not even take a breathe when he tried to examine her with a stethoscope. Rather than try to calm her, he instead kept berating her. Humiliated, she left the office in tears. I'm not sure what the other patients must have thought. Upon hearing her story, I visited this website and saw that others were telling the exact same story. I then called the office and asked to speak with this doctor, only to have him do the same thing to me. I could not explain what had happened because he kept talking loudly over me. I could not believe that a medical professional would behave in such a manner. I have since called the office manager and may take this further, as this man should not be seeing patients. I am not sure what the problem is, but it is a serious one, and I am hoping that he will be removed from this practice. I certainly will never advise anyone to go there, which is unfortunate, as my family has always had wonderful experiences there in the past.\",\n",

       "  \"I decided to try doctor Borrison after Dr. Belton retired from private practice and reccomended a different doctor in the Los Ovlios Group that Dr. Borrison is a part of. I chose not to see the exact doctor that Dr. Belton had reccomended because my husband wanted me try seeing a female OBGYN. I do not generally enjoy giving negative reviews but this doctor warrants one. In fact, if one star was not the lowest rating I would rate her on the negative balance scale. OFFICE ENVIRONMENT: This group of doctors is located in several office suites within a medical complex with a couople doctors sharing each suite. It is extremely busy and the service is very impersonal. I felt that the office staff did not enjoy their jobs and the wait time was very long. Also, while I was there a couple, obviously waiting for a pre-natal appointment, were getting comfortable enough that I am shocked no one suggested they check into a hotel room. It was not what I personally would like to view while waiting in the lobby of a professional organization. DR. BORRISON: The first thing I did not find to my taste was her overall appearance the day I had my appointment with her. Her white coat was longer than her skirt and she was clearly not comfortable in the heels she was wearing. This is not the sort of attire appropriate for a professional office environment. I am a VERY tolerant person in spite of being highly conservative in my own lifestyle and I could have overlooked this had it ot been for the other issues. Dr. Borrison's overall manner was rude and I agree with what another reviewer wrote stating that regardless of all her high qualifications she would be better suited as a lawyer or perhaps in the Business world (other than the business of beinga doctor). She talked down to me as though I could not possibly be educated (perhaps my wearing full Islamic attire from head to toe gave her that impression?). She also apparently did not carefully review my chart which I painstakingly took the time to fill out in detail well in advance of my appointment and which included a letter as well as lab results from a different physician. Even after I answered her questions she seemed to forget what I told her. At this point I was still willing to give the benefit of doubt because everyone has bad days and MAYBE she was just having a bad day (or possibly hung over? that thought did cross my mind even though I have never consumed alcoholic beverages and can only speculate what being hungover must be like). When I discussed with her a medication and my dosage she said wrote a prescription for me with the wrong dose on it. I pointed this out to her and she said that I should try a lower dose. This was one of those moments when I can say I was literally dumbfounded. Seriously, she graduated from medical school and actually managed to get licensed??? I explained to her why I was currently on the said dose of that particular medication and why it would be futile to take less. Mind you it was not an odd dose or anything abnormal and trust me I would love not to have to take that kind of medicine at all except that some things in life happen that way. So she re-wrote the prescription. When I went to have the prescription dispensed she had apparently made a mistake and the pharmacist had to call her office. When I finally did get it dispensed it was for the wrong and lower dose of the medicine. I told the pharmacist to call the doctor because it is NOT the correct dose. The pharmacist did and once again dispened the prescription but still at a lower and incorrect dosage. So I declined the medicine because this was becoming a waste of my time and the pharmacist's and it was just too much trouble. I instead made an appointment with Anjali Tate, MD and never had a single problem with getting the medicine I needed at all. The treatment I received, both on a professional and personal ,from Dr. Tate was infinitely better! SOMETHING TO NOTE: Just this past March when I went for a scheduled c-section with my fifth baby and was cheking in at labor and delivery I overheard nurses talking about a patient who was on the verge of delivering her baby. Apparently they had called Dr. Borrison repeatedly and she still had not arrived. From what I gleaned from this conversation she had been given ample enough notice of this pending birth. Her apparent lack of promptness seemed not professionally acceptable and the nurses sure were quite vexed with her at that moment. Just the mention of her name gave me undeisrable flashbacks of that office visit a few years ago and how glad I was to have a very confident and prompt doctor to deliver my baby and not Dr. Borrison! I never saw the lady who was a patient of Dr. Borrison's but I sure did feel sorry for her that day.\",\n",

       "  'I went to Dr. Schey for the concern of menopausal bleeding on the combi-patch I was originally prescribed by another GYN. I visited her three times. The first time, 9/11/14, she was offensive with me but I took it without saying anything about it. I noticed her high handed way of communicating but did my best to overlook the disrespectfulness in which she conducted herself. Due to my concern, she insisted I undergo multiple tests, two quite painful, to assure I did not have cancer. I followed her instructions. My second, 9/16/14, and third, 9/ 22/14, visits, she was nicer (although clearly having social conversation with the ultra sound tech, which I found unprofessional) so I made a point of chalking up her rudeness with me the first time I saw her to an anomaly. Our discussions had been that once we were passed these tests, that she and I would DISCUSS what might be the next decision for me. She had already mentioned there were multiple alternatives, including anti-depressants, to handle the problem I was concerned with. On 926/14, I got a call from her Tech / Assistant, whom had already shown me to be less than competent and frequently confused. I was told that all of my tests were normal / benign and that I was being put on a new drug. I asked her to spell the drug for me, which took her 4 attempts to get done. Suddenly Dr. Schey was on the phone, this was not an announced or transferred callit was sudden, as if she had taken the phone away from her Asst. Her conduct with me was very much the same as the first time I saw her, high handed, rapid speed talking and intolerant. I attempted to speak with her reasonably anyway and wanted to discuss with her WHY she recommended the drug she wanted to prescribe, to tell her of the terrible experience I had just had with my PCP prescribing anti-anxiety med, etc. She was unwilling to let me complete a single sentence or to talk to me like a reasonable human being. I came to her for ONE reason only, she ran me through a battery of tests and I expected a couple minute conversation thereafter, in fact, it had been agreed upon. When I began explaining to her that I had had a terrible experience with an anti-anxiety med, she cut me off, and said, I know, thats why Im suggesting this.. My response was, No, you do not know. This just happened and Im explaining it to you to note in your chart and know as my Doctor. Her response, I dont know why you are being so defensive?. I told her I was not. What she called defensive was to me, attempting to have a conversation about MY health with MY Doctor. She was projecting. I had also went on to tell her that I had noticed the combi-patch does indicate a possibility of bleeding for up to six months as a side effect. My thought was that since Id been bleeding for nearly five months, perhaps we should give it another 6 weeks to see if it subsides. I was not able to get through this thought, as Dr. Schey interrupted to me to say, All estrogen supplements have the possible side effect of bleeding. If you dont mind continuing to bleed, sure, stay on it. I do not appreciate a doctor who has such vast mood swings and cannot carry on a reasonable conversation if her mood does not fit it. I do not appreciate a Dr. who has her less than able Assistant call me to mandate a drug I must take now without conversation. And I do not appreciate anyone speaking to me as if my concerns and health are not of import. This is not the way you speak with a client. This is not the way you speak with a human being. Dr. Schey has severe mood problems, based on my observations, and is unable to be even reasonably civil when her mood does not dictate it. She is willing to put you through high dollar testing but doesnt seem interested in doing the obvioussuch as doing blood tests on a woman who has bled consistently for over four months to see if she is vitamin or iron deficient, or suggesting going off of the combi-patch and doing hormone testing to get it right INSTEAD OF GUESSING. I do not recommend her to anyone who is interested in their health and being knowledgeable. I do not recommend her to anyone who sincerely wants to partner with their Doctor about their well being. If you are the type that views Doctors as the absolute and do not take seriously the fact that they are practicing medicine on you.then her God complex may work for you. Its a shame. I sincerely went to her to help me solve a singular problem. I took a lot of time out of my life, not to mention paid a notable amount of money to solve the problem. I was so hopeful that we could figure it out. She cant or wont. I will be talking to my PCP, who is amazing, and asking his opinion and for a referral to a reasonable GYN. Dr. Schey needs to make sure she does not become a problem transferring my records. She made her money..which I believe was her purpose. My singular concern was irrelevant to her.',\n",

You decided not to send me home and asked me to stay.   One hour later you wanted to break my water which I didnt allow because I wanted to have a delivery as natural as possible.  Two hours later you gave me an ultimatum, either I let you work  (for me it was to let you rush) or I had to leave the hospital because I was taking a bed that someone else would need. How do you find this if you were in my shoes? First delivery, having contractions, dealing with a doctor that was not listening to you and the signs of your body, treating badly the nurses and the patient. My initial answer was to leave and as I was getting changed and ready I became panicked because I was not going to be able to monitor the heart rate of my baby. So in tears I decided to stay, you put back the IVF with such a rage that blood was everywhere and gave me a lot of pain. From that point I was blocked, because I was doing something I didnt want and that wasnt necessary, because as you said, the baby was not in any risk but you had a busy day at the hospital. Many hours later when the pushing time arrive,  I begged you not to make me lie down to push and again you didnt listen to me and just thought about what was more comfortable or easier for you.  After 2.5 hours of pushing we had to use forceps and my baby was out. You throw her to me with such a hard face, in such a way that I wish you had never been the first person to touch my baby. It is hard to forget.  The nurse mentioned you were an expert on forceps and now I understand why, how can you become an expert on forceps? By not listening and caring about your patients, by rushing them, by not letting the body take its time to do the job, by forcing moms to do unnecessary procedures.\\n \\nMonths later a nurse that was that day at the hospital saw me in a restaurant and came to me to ask how I was doing. She mentioned I am sorry you went through all of that, it was bad luck you had Dr. Kassenoff that day, with the other doctors of that practice you would have never experienced that situation. I am also sorry I didnt have any of the other doctors of the practice or that I wasnt strong enough to ask for a change of doctor.\\n \\nI was very clear with Dr. Adler when I first came to the practice about my desire of having a natural birth. He said he didnt understand why I wanted to go through all that pain but he and his team would support my desire. What support? I dont know how much you communicate with each other about the patients, but clearly you were not following his initial commitment.\\n \\nThere was no reason for you to break my water other than to rush as neither my baby nor me were in any risk.  As a doctor, I guess you have done thousands of deliveries and it seems that for you a hospital is a factory.   For patients, in particular, first time moms, it is one of the most important experiences of their life and it is your role to be supportive and human, you cannot imagine the emotional damage your attitude, your hard words and your coldness cause. That experience was very traumatic for my baby and me and had negative consequences.\\n \\nYou are a mother of two and I do not know how your deliveries were like but please reconsider the way how you interact with your patients, we are not cows, we certainly do not have to pay for your unhappiness with your profession or with your life.\\n \\nThere is no need to answer this letter, you can not take back my experience, feelings and traumas. I just need to let all those negative feelings get out through this letter.\\n \\nYou have a direct impact on life, use your talent to do good, it goes further than delivering healthy babies and becoming the best at using forceps.\\n',\n",

She did a sonogram and told me that she couldn't detect a heartbeat. She was very sympathetic and explained what would happen next. She scheduled me for a confirmation sonogram that same day and upon confirmation of the unviable pregnancy was able to schedule surgery for two days later that would ensure that no tissue remained in my uterus. I am in the military and will be leaving Sierra Vista within the next few months. I am so disappointed that I will not be able to have Dr. Patterson for my next pregnancy. I had such a positive experience with her as my OB-GYN, despite the less than optimal outcome of the pregnancy, which, of course, in no way reflects on her. She is very no-nonsense and will give you advice as a medical professional. I trust her implicitly and am truly sorry that there are not more doctors of her caliber.

       "  \"Here is a word to the wise: If you are in incredible, intense pain, driving yourself to the hospital might not be the best idea, because you could end up in a death trap called Fountain Valley Regional Medical Center. I'll try to make my story as short as possible: Monday: I quit a terrible job. It was liberating. Tuesday: Had a bit of a tummy ache. Wednesday: Was in absolutely horrible abdominal pain. All I did was go back and forth between my bed and the couch and lay there. By Wednesday night it was clear something was terribly wrong, and I drove to the ER at Fountain Valley Regional Medical Center. The Emergency Room was actually quite good. My doctor seemed to know what he was doing, I had an MRI and some blood work done and I was diagnosed with Diverticulitis, which is an intestinal infection. I was not in good shape, and the ER doctor sent me to the main hospital at about 4:00 AM Thursday Morning. Here is where things go horribly wrong. For the first ten hours I was in the hospital, no doctor saw me. I was given a full menu of food to choose from, but because I was in such pain I ate nothing. I just drank very small amounts of water, and I was on IV fluids anyway. Dr. Al-Zaid came in, a fat old slovenly Indian man, and basically told me I needed to sit there for a couple of days because the IV anti-biotics would take care of the infection. By Friday morning I was actually starting to feel better. So I started eating small amounts of food, because my appetite was returning. I still had access to the full menu of food at the hospital, but I read on the internet on my iPhone that I should be on a low-fiber diet, so I tried to maintain that. I ate small amounts, and was feeling good. All Dr. Al-Zaid told me this day was the test came back showing I had a fatty liver, and I should consider losing weight. Nothing like a fat doctor telling you you need to trim down. At about 2:00 AM on Saturday morning the pain came back hardcore, in sickening waves. I was definitely taking a turn for the worse. Saturday morning my mom came to visit me again, and saw I was in a bad state. I once again stopped eating because I had no appetite. Since it was so clear that my doctor either didn't know what the hell to tell a person with my condition, or he just didn't give a shit about his job, my mom demanded a GI specialist be brought in. After a some himming and hawing by the hospital staff, they finally got a specialist in on late Saturday afternoon. He was an excellent doctor, and told me I should be on a clear liquid diet for a speedy recovery, then switch to low residue diet, then low fiber diet, then high fiber diet. Only then did Dr. Al-Zaid put me on a restricted menu from the kitchen. So, to make this clear, for the condition I had I now know it takes a two-pronged attack to get over it. Number one: antibiotics. Those they gave me. Number two: very strict diet, starting with clear liquid, and working your way up the food chain. Well, upon admittance to the hospital, I was not told about that second part by a reliable source until SIXTY HOURS after I was first put into my room, and almost SEVENTY TWO hours after I showed up in the ER. I was given access to eight full meals, and thank god I only ate very lightly on Friday or it would have been even worse, possibly requiring major surgery. I ended up checking out of the hospital on Tuesday afternoon, almost six full days after I first showed up. It is my opinion that had I been given proper dietary advice on Thurssday morning when I was first admitted to the hospital, I would have been out by Saturday afternoon or Sunday morning and I would have been fine. I am happy to report that this was almost a year ago, and thanks to the advice of Dr. Surinder Saini, my GI specialist, I have not had another bout of diverticulitis. But I will never forget the horrible, careless, and frankly dangerous stay that I had at Fountain Valley Regional Medical center. Avoid at all costs.\",\n",

Additionally, he makes you sign a form that states that if you cancel or reschedule an appointment at any time (can be a week or more before) you will be billed for a full session ($100).

Dr. 1 has performed more successful tubal reversals, resulting in the birth of more babies, than any other doctor in the world. Dr. 2 became the first certified Tubal Ligation Reversal Surgeon in the U.S. Their practice has detailed pregnancy statistics that document the success of their patients. When we first discussed my tubal reversal, Dr. Csankany asked, Where did you find them? The Internet? What did they do, just send you on your way and say, Good luck! There was no sound basis for this automatic bias.Second, as we discussed how the procedure had gone and the results of the pathology tests, she declared loudly with sarcasm, Well, good luck! in regards to the chances of me getting pregnant. From the results of the pathology tests, there was no basis for being pessimistic. Even if there had been, the pessimism was unnecessary. Third, within the discussion of the increased risks of a tubal ectopic pregnancy, I said because of the tubal ligation. She jumped in with, No, it was because of the tubal ligation reversal. Not only was the tone used combative and the correction unnecessary (because the tubal ligation reversal would not have happened without a tubal ligation first), it was not entirely correct since tubal ligations also increase the risk of a tubal ectopic pregnancy. Finally, when I asked if a vaginal ultrasound could be performed at the HCG level of 1500 as recommended by my surgeon, she answered that yes you could, but it is not industry standard. We went in a circle on this a few times. Her previous, unwarranted verbal lashing of my surgeon and her stressing of the phrase industry standard gave the impression that she was attempting to reiterate that she did not approve of my surgeon. Additionally, I am not willing to risk the money that I spent on tubal ligation reversal on a possible loss of a tube from a tubal ectopic pregnancy due to not following my surgeons instructions. PS - This review would not have been posted if the front desk had not snickered at the question of if they have a general email address for the practice to which I could send a note for the doctor.

It was not until then that I was offered pain meds or fluids.

She also diagnosed me with RA at my first appointment and put me on a potentially dangerous medication when I had yet to exhibit any symptoms of RA, and as far as I\\'m concerned, still have. I explained that my general practitioner had taken me off the medications she gave me because they were affecting another (unrelated) condition. She never offered to try any different drugs, and just sent me off for more lab work, saying: \"If you don\\'t hear from us, call back.\" When I did call back, her nurse told me \"You\\'ll be getting them in the mail\" instead of going over the results with me.

I was directed to Dr. Armstron (for my complaints of chronic pain bilateral in my arms proximal to elbows, especially due to sleep patterns). He would not look at the testing I provided, discredited them without even looking at them. Told me the Fwave test for testing nerve root damage was garbage. Claimed he was the all mighty of the ncv test because he has done 30,000 of them. Insisted on insulting me because of my age, 54. Then proceeded to perform an ncv across my wrist for carpal tunnel syndrome. Had he looked at the previous extensive thorough testing he would see that his redundant test was not needed nor was it an issue of my medical complaint. I was looking to get elbow braces that would limit elbow travel while I sleep. I was going to get them through Amazon but the girlfriend told me to go to the doctor for a prescription since I already pay a large premium for insurance. Little did I know I would open myself up to a jack-as like this guy. I'll go back to Amazon. Kaiser is the worst insurance I have ever had, as well as the most expensive. This doctor also claimed that the government is scheduled to stop paying for NCVs because they are so misused and I have an opinion on that. I have had maybe 6 thorough NCVs and this wrist only NCV. It is a very very objective test when administered by an impartial person. Neurologist are not impartial they know how to administer it to the advantage to whom they play for. Neurologists should be barred from the administration of this vital test and that only technicians should be allowed to do this test. A neurologist should only be allowed to read the objective results. In my opinion this is the worst ego driven doctor I have ever seen. I will be pursuing the return of my co-pays and my time as well as running away from kaiser as fast as I can. Not only that this doctor has sent the pre-existing condition enforcers, within the kaiser domain, after me for payment on something I never wanted or complained about to begin with.

She has been in and out of the hospital to manage her pain brought on by her policystic kidney disease.  Our doctor has been prescribing her medicine to help with the pain that does not/will not affect the baby in any way.  With her being an Obgyn I do not think she would ever give anyone medicine that would be harmful to the baby.  My wife went there to seek out alternatives to the pills since we are approaching the third trimester and she will not be able to take them at that point.  Our doctor faxed her complete medical file over to Dr. Neleson's office prior to her appointment.  When she got to the appointment he did not even read her file but instead chose to explain to ther that our baby could be deformed because of the medicine she was prescribed.  He was then rude, obnoxious, and completley unprofessional.  On another note, the staff was rude when she was trying to get the appoinment.  Dr. Neleson then printed info off of the internet about what taking her medicine does to animals.  On top of all this Dr. Neleson told my wife that he was going to fax in something to our Obgyn's office saying &quot;not to send pregnant women in.&quot;  When my wife asked Dr. Neleson about possibly trying accupuncture he told her &quot;good luck finding someone that will do accupuncture on a pregnant woman in Dallas.&quot;  Additionally, that very same day we called the accupuncurist our Dr. recommended and had the appointment.  The accupuncturist explained that they treat pregnant women very frequently.  Dr. Neleson also told my wife that her pain was &quot;psychological&quot; and referred her to a pysychologist.  This was very insulting.  I do not think that my wife put the cysts on her kidneys with her mind.  I do not think she put the cysts on her ovaries with her mind.  I do not think she gave herself a kidney infection in her mind.  We are only now 23 weeks into the pregnancy and have been admitted to Presby of Plano 3 times.  One of which resulted in an 8 day stay.  the whole point of going to Dr. Neleson was to seek other ways to manage the pain.  He did not do that or render any other service than to be a completely unprofessional, rude, insulting jerk.  My wife left in tears and was upset all day.  No one should tell a pregnant woman &quot;her baby will be deformed&quot; ever, but especially a Dr.  When my wife asked him why he was being so rude Dr. Neleson replied with something to the affect of, &quot;Oh, I am from New York.&quot;  I just wanted to let all these happenings be known.  I would not recommend this Dr. Neleson to anyone ever.  I am still in disbelief at his lack of professionalism, symapthy, courtesy, and respect.  \",\n",

He was diagnosed with severe eczema and food allergies and because of his diagnoses we visited with her often (up to 3 visits a month). She eventually referred us to a dermatologist and allergist (the best decision she\\'s made in the entire year we saw her). Since then, we now visit with his specialist a lot more and less of Dr. Carreras. Well, one afternoon he had an allergic reaction so i took him in and she gave him an \"allergy shot\" without explaining what the shot was and the side effects. She also prescribed him steroids to help the itching or so she said it was suppose to help. We went home that night and gave him the steroids for 5 days. He had a REALLY bad reaction to the medicine so we rushed him to Children\\'s Hospital where he was hospitalized for 4 days. His specialist came to visit with him and explained that steroids are AWFUL for babies and they would NEVER prescribe them to any of their patience. They also said, the \"allergy shot\" she gave him was ALSO steroids. I informed them of her prescribing the steroids more then 3 times in the last 9 months. They were horrified and offered in helping me find a new pediatrician. We we\\'re at the hospital because of her quick actions when she should have probably spoke with his specialist first to see what they agree on (lack of communication).

He did not explain why he did not continue me on the anti anxiety medication that had worked to stabilize me in the past until I was able to work up to the level of zoloft that would control my depression and anxiety. Then I would no longer need the anti anxiety medication, or would need it very infrequently. After I called his office a second time to tell him about my adverse reactions, he instructed me to go to the emergency room because I am going through withdrawal!

       "  'Everyone raves about Dr Fink, and yet 99% of women now a days don\\'t ever get to see him. If you are considering this practice because you have heard great things about Dr Fink, know that more likely that not, you will never see him. My review on his practice: STILLBIRTH DELIVERY at 34 weeks pregnant on 1.1.15 Longest and most heartfelt review I will write on yelp: From day 1, I never waned to see Dr Tumero, as a close friend of mine had a still birth in 2nd tri under her care. Said friend reviewed her file with head doctor (Fink), both came to the conclusion that closer monitoring and treatment could had made a difference. Fast forward and guess who I get stuck with? Yes, Dr. Tumero Details:I had a regular doctors visit on 12/31/14, during my ultrasound, tech noticed that heartbeat was slow, she quickly called Dr Simmel in and I was asked to head over to baptist for further monitoring. Upon arriving to baptist (5 minutes later, as building is right next door), my daughters heartbeat was detected by monitor used by nurse. Five minutes later, Dr Tumero (who was on duty at hospital) shows up and requests bed side u/s. U/s tech arrived within a couple of minutes and by then, my daughter was gone. Between time of my arrival, check in, blah blah blah, about 10 minutes passed. Though you maybe thinking, 10 minutes is not that long, it is when your child\\'s life is at risk. Knowing what I know now (further testing detected that I have an autoimmune disease which often correlates with still births if left untreated) I understand that OTHER factors COULD have caused my daughters passing, however, we did not know (still don\\'t) what \"the cause\" was when it was all going down,so my thoughts are: If Dr. Simmel called baptist to let them know that I was heading there with baby with slow heartbeat, why the delay in dr Tumero showing up? My daughter passed away at this hospital, all while we were present. Why was an emergency c- section not done if one minute there was heartbeat and not the next? so many questions. I know that nothing will ever bring her back, but I question the response time and how the situation was handled. ------- As if what I described above is not reason enough as to why to avoid this practice, here are additional mishaps that took place during pregnancy. I had a VERY healthy pregnancy, so my visits were short and to the point. However, there were many mishaps along the way, one of them being that a test which is done during 2nd trimester detecting abnormalities was overlooked. They apologized for that, and during that time I didn\\'t think it was a big deal, but after having lost my child, I wish that every single test had been done. Aside from that, there was a lot of back and forth with medication prescribed (Diclegis for nausea and vomiting) the office sent prescription to my pharmacy for wrong amount (less pills) so I was having to go back for refills every couple of weeks, spending more money per bottler, wasting time and gas. It wasn\\'t until the pharmacist asked me why I hadn\\'t just ordered 100 pills to begin with vs 30 at a time, that we were able to correct the issue by calling obgyn and having them send correct prescription. U/s tech with long hair- this lady is one of the most unpleasant people I have ever met in the industry. I do not recall her name, but I saw her twice early in pregnancy and requested not to see her again. I tried both times to initiate small talk (commenting on her daughter\\'s ballet pictures/ asking about her day) and got nothing. She always had a crappy face on, and was non responsive. Having an u/s done is both exciting and stressful, she did zero to make the experience more pleasant. Please stay away from this place if you are expecting, it is my only suggestion. During a doctor\\'s career, there is no doubt that lives will be lost for x or y reason. I just REALLY feel that my daughter\\'s life could have been spared, if things had been addressed promptly.',\n",

       "  'My story: I started seeing Dr. Kokinos more than a year ago and have spent thousands of dollars for her to cosmetically correct my varicose and spider veins. My legs now look worse than before and I am left scarred On my very first sclerotherapy session she used a foam sclerotherapy solution. I developed an ulcer on my leg which left a large scar. When she saw it she said \"I used too high of concentration in the solution\" and then changed to a weaker solution after. She admitted it was her fault. It is more than obvious that when first doing sclero treatment she should have worked here way up with concentration instead of leaving me permanently scarred. Even though there pare potential side affects with hyper-pigmentation and ulcers these are avoidable when the correct concentration is used. The weaker solution did not give me any further ulcers, but it did not help either. I have since been seen by another vascular office that confirmed the ulcer and scarring was from the concentration and I have since written to Dr. Kokinos several times in order to resolve this. To date she has not responded to provide a resolution (other than returning for additional treatments which is not an option) for the scarring (which is permanent and cannot be changed) , ineffective treatments, and the additional expense of having to seek another facility for treatment. I highly encourage others to be very careful in selecting a doctor for these types pf procedures. The next step for me is to file suit in court which will be done at the end of the month if she does not respond with a resolution. Definitely not what I had expected to have to do.

I like that he performs a heart test with all of his new patients. He has a pleasant demeanor. He took some time with me to answer my questions. There is a detail that he missed that did concern me, however. For example, I was taking a particular medication for a particular reason and I asked him to take me off of it. He wrote me a prescription to come off of it, but in the next few days after a referral he gave me to another specialist for something else, ironically, it became very apparent to me that I should not go off that med for a whole different medical reason. I was the one to bring that to his attention, but he would have had the results from the other doctor too. (Then again the other doctor did not make this logical connection either.) I would prefer if he or the other one had caught it instead of me. In addition, he did not seem concerned about a certain factor in a bad blood test result I had. I think it was caused by yet another medication. I stopped that medication myself and it solved the problem. Again, I wonder why he did not suggest this. The conclusion I am coming to is that I wish he researched more and showed me as a patient more individualized concern and time, even when I was not present in his office. I may totally be dreaming to expect this from any doctor though. I guess my advice to all is to stay informed yourself as much as you can. Do not leave it all in any doctor's hands. When I am at the office for an appointment, it seems to run smoothly. When I am calling in with a question or for a prescription, however, I have had very inconsistent results.

I was impressed by his level of knowledge. Most importantly, I felt my baby and I were safe in his care. A friend of mine had recommended him after her all natural birth and I was very pleased with the recommendation. When I was 38w2d pregnant, I went in for a routine checkup. The appointment was on a Friday. After listening to the heartbeat, Dr. Martin informed me that all looked great. I was ready to leave my appointment for work when he instructs me to head to the hospital. In his words he could break my water and I would have the baby in less than 4 hours. I was shocked and worried. I heard him say all was well and suddenly he seemed eager for me to have my baby in just hours. I asked what was wrong and his response was why do I want to continue being pregnant. I\\'m \"almost\" 39 weeks so it was perfectly fine. This was not my first pregnancy. I was induced with my daughter and the Pitocin was an awful experience. I was in no rush to experience that again. So I said that my preference was to let my son come when he is ready. Dr. Martin was put off by it but then said, well he\\'ll be here this weekend anyway. Sure enough, that Sunday I went into labor on my own. My intention was to always get the epidural which I did as soon as I arrived to the hospital. Unfortunately, when it came time to push, the epidural stopped working. I wasn\\'t mentally prepared for this and I needed just a few minutes to compose myself. After pushing twice, literally for 2 minutes, Dr. Martin made the decision to use the vacuum to retrieve my son. It was not medically necessary. He was just in a rush to be completed with me as he had other c-sections scheduled at the same time. Understand that the vacuum is typically used in emergency situations or when the mother has been pushing for 3+ hours. Neither of which were my case. My son ended up with a bruise on his head which is normal when using the vacuum. However, because our blood type didn\\'t mix he was jaundice and this bruise caused an increased level which required him to stay in the hospital. I was so disappointed in Dr. Martin. I felt that the 38 weeks of him listening, being compassionate, and me trusting him went down the drain due to his lack of patience. I later found out by the nurses in the hospital that he has a high rate of inductions and c-sections. I even saw a lactation consultant at a different hospital who worked with him in the past and she said the same exact thing. I also found out that my friend had an all natural experience with him because she went into labor quickly and there was no time for anything else, not even to administer an epidural. Overall, if you know you are going to have a c-section and you don\\'t mind being induced (you should mind but to each her own) then he is a great doctor for you.

       "  'I sought treatment from Dr. Radovic for a hammer toe that was giving me problems. Growing up, he treated my entire family for and podiatry issues we had and I rememberd him as a good doctor. He recommended I do surgery and have cadaver cartilage used to fix my problem. He also suggests sewing the toe (second to the pinky) to the middle toe. Immediately I tell him no and that theres no way I want my toes sewn together and how embarrassing that would be. He then continually tells me that there WILL be a seam there and that you would NEVER be able to tell that they were sewn together. He was so persistent about it that I eventually agreed because he, the dr, says I will keep toes that still look seperated and normal. I had the surgery and at the 6th post op appointment I had he says. \"This isn\\'t molding like I want it too. Given a couple weeks I\\'m sure it will though\". MOLDING?! Panicked I say \"No you specifically said it wouldn\\'t mold and that there would be a seam!\". He just had a zoned clueless look and says umm well it kinda needs to mold a littttle. For sanitary reasons its just healthier this way. Also at one of the post ops prior to this one, he says there might be a slight fungus starting so he wanted to have me use a special fungus medicine called Castellani Paint and that the only problem is that it was not covered by insurance. He tells me its $50 and I tell him I definitely cannot afford that and that I\\'d research it online when I got home. He then says, \"Well, let me check to see if I have some in the back I can give you.\" Of course he did. So he opens it and applies it to my toe. I say thank you so much thinking he gave this to me. He then follows me to the counter and tells the receptionist that I owe $50 for the Castellani Paint. I was stunned and when I told him that I had just said I couldnt afford that. His reply was that he had already opened and applied it so I had to purchase it. I told them I dont have 50 bucks to give you today for this he says he will LET me pay 1/2  then and the rest next week. My whole experience with Dr. Radovic and his staff has been awful. He looks at you and nods his head and pretends to care but then completely ignores anything you say. After all this they I still had to pay a bill that was more than $600, which is not anywhere near the amount they told me it would be. I eventually just paid so I can be done with the whole thing! I have had increasing pain since this surgery and recently saw an orthopedic surgeon to correct this. It really is a shame because I do remember him as a good doctor years ago, and had always recommended him. It\\'s clear and obvious he is now just another greedy, money hungry doctor.',\n",

       "  \"Dr. Reimnitz is a rock star, plain and simple. I selected her after changing from Kaiser. I had just had a rather traumatic miscarriage experience that was poorly handled and Dr. Reimnitz started by running every test and doing everything possible to make sure that I was in perfect health moving forward. When we got pregnant just a couple months later, she was a dream to work with. First, she is incredibly kind and relaxed. Her confidence and experience (having delivered over 5000 babies!) makes even the most neurotic pregnant woman calm down and enjoy the process. On top of that, she is extremely knowledgeable. There was not a single question I asked that she did not have a very informed answer on. Lastly, she is not your average run-of-the-mill doctor, this woman is surgeon-grade excellence. I ended up needing a c-section because my little guy was breech and she was a total pro. If you have to be operated on, you want the very best and that person is Dr. Reimnitz. EVERY SINGLE nurse that checked my scar during my hospital stay responded with shock at how great my incision looked and told me I would heal with almost zero complications and minimal scarring. On top of that, SEVERAL nurses told me that if they had to pick a doctor to perform surgery on them or someone they loved, she would be at the top of a very short list. When the nurses who see patients from all over, every single day, say that your doctor would be their pick, you know you are rocking medical gold. Now, whenever I hear c-section horror stories or get asked by pregnant women how my experience was, I get to share a positive example of how having a great doctor makes all the difference. By the end of my first week I was almost 100% back to normal and enjoying every minute with my new baby. I believe every woman and child deserves excellent medical care, but with today's vast range of options, it can be confusing to know where to turn and who to choose. Dr. Reimnitz is phenomenal and her medical expertise can't be beat.\",\n",

       "  'I second reviewer Sara W\\'s review, Dr. Kokinos ruined my legs too. Please read the other filtered reviews before considering Dr. Kokinos. My story: I started seeing Dr. Kokinos more than a year ago and have spent thousands of dollars for her to cosmetically correct my varicose and spider veins. My legs now look worse than before and I am left scarred On my very first sclerotherapy session she used a foam sclerotherapy solution. I developed an ulcer on my leg which left a large scar. When she saw it she said \"I used too high of concentration in the solution\" and then changed to a weaker solution after. She admitted it was her fault. It is more than obvious that when first doing sclero treatment she should have worked here way up with concentration instead of leaving me permanently scarred. Even though there pare potential side affects with hyper-pigmentation and ulcers these are avoidable when the correct concentration is used. The weaker solution did not give me any further ulcers, but it did not help either. I have since been seen by another vascular office that confirmed the ulcer and scarring was from the concentration and I have since written to Dr. Kokinos several times in order to resolve this. To date she has not responded to provide a resolution (other than returning for additional treatments which is not an option) for the scarring (which is permanent and cannot be changed) , ineffective treatments, and the additional expense of having to seek another facility for treatment. I highly encourage others to be very careful in selecting a doctor for these types pf procedures. The next step for me is to file suit in court which will be done at the end of the month if she does not respond with a resolution. Definitely not what I had expected to have to do. I will post photos of her \"handiwork\" soon. ',\n",

       "  ' It took 3 hours just to get in. The woman at the front desk gave us bad directions. We stopped at every help desk on another floor because we got lost and every desk was unmanned. Even after we rang a bell no one came. \\n\\nWhen we were waiting people kept going in before us, and even as my fiance was pacing around and almost crying the lady at the window just kept reading her book. We waited so long that I had to use their unsanitary bathroom (In which I contracted strep throat from the bathroom door handle, I later found out. It is the only place I could have gotten it from because I am a homemaker and I never really go out unless its an emergency like that was.) They said if we left the room we would be bumped to the back of the list, which made it nearly impossible for bathroom breaks, food breaks, smoke breaks, or anything without rushing. We tried not to leave at all because of that stupid rule. So we sat there watching the only station we were allowed to watch- which was Nick with an I Carly movie or something extremely lame and boring.\\n\\nWhen we finally got in the nurse was inexperienced and made my fiances arm bleed all over. He didnt know how to properly take blood and got it all over the bed and my fiances pants. When the doctor came in he asked my fiance to lay down on the bed. My fiance showed the doctor the bloody sheets and the doctor told him it was ok and to lay down. So my fiance had to lay on bloody sheets that they wouldnt change, or at least cover up with something. When my fiance offered to give the doctor his insurance information and the doctor said, \"No, that is ok.\" Later, the prescription he prescribed was not covered by medicaid because the doctor refused to check. Before we came into the hospital my fiance called and told them to get his medical history ready so that it would make everything move faster, but by the time we got out it had still been 4 hours total. So that night when we went to go get his medicine and we couldnt get it until the doctor confirmed with the pharmacy that it was okay to get the knock off brand. He had to wait another whole day just to get relief from his pain because of that.  \\n\\nThe funny part was that in the 3 hours we were in the waiting area someone was laying in a chair with a coat over their head. In that 3 hours no one came to check on that person, and nor did they move. They could have been dead and the lady at the desk reading Stephen King would have been totally oblivious.\\n \\nThe nurses did not answer my questions that was important to my health as well. They gave my fiance something to drink that contained sulfates, of which I am allergic. I was honestly scared to kiss my fiance after he drank it because I thought my own throat would swell up from my own allergic reaction. It was a simple question and they refused to answer whether or not it would be safe for me to be near. \\n\\nIn the waiting room there were two elderly women, one with a bladder problem, and she had been waiting for two hours. What if she got stuck in the bathroom and they bumped her to the back of the list? That poor old woman was not taken care of and they didnt grant her any exception with the bathroom either. \\n\\nThe only person at the hospital that was helpful was a nice lady that cleaning staff. She was nice enough to stop what she was doing and help us find our way. She should be paid more if she was the only person that could help us in the hospital. \\n\\nIn conclusion, I never want to go there again, especially not in an emergency. The staff is NOT well informed, they are very cold and uncaring, the nurses are unsanitary, the bathrooms do not have wipes to get the door knob with, and the waiting was hell. Do not go to this hospital because they will let you die in the waiting room before they would ever let you in.  ',\n",

       "  'Doctor Halsten is motivated by money, not a desire to help her patients.Allow me to explain. Over the course of the past five years my wife has been with the same Oncologist at Kaiser Permanente. Throughout the course of her treatment, her Oncologist was a little more cautious about treatment than we had hoped, but he was extremely responsive and involved in my wife\\'s treatment plan. Over the last few years my wife sought a second opinion in order to develop a more aggressive treatment plan for her breast cancer. This led us to Doctor Helsten. After consulting with her and paying out of pocket to UCSD, my wife and I decided that the options presented to us by Doctor Helsten, which included the potential for clinical trials with new treatments at UCSD and genomic testing, were worth changing insurance companies, oncologists, and primary care providers for. We made the switch to Blue Cross Blue Shield and tried to schedule an appointment. Whereas Doctor Helsten was readily available for consultation when we were paying out of pocket, as soona as we switched insurance companies, we were no longer a priority for her time.Three weeks. My wife had to wait three weeks for a consult. Three weeks without treatment of any kind. And so, the cancer progressed, as it does when it is ignored. The day before my wife\\'s appointment, she ended up in the ER because she could not walk. A member of Doctor Helsten\\'s oncology team consulted with my wife and recommended radiation. Then the ortho team recommended surgery to support the femur and hip which contained cancer. That actually alleviated a lot of pain. Thank you ortho team.After the surgery, still no appearance or call from Doctor Helsten.UCSD put my wife in Cottonwood \"care facility\" and because I work out of state, I was unable to intervene until after she was removed from the hospital. This action had no bearing on her directly until my wife ended up in the ER because she was anemic from excessive radiation and no nutrition at the care facility (think overmedication). At that point, the oncology team told her she was \"no longer a candidate for chemotherapy or radiation\" and essentially left her in our capable hands.Still no visit from Doctor Helsten.We went home and ended up in the ER two days later because my wife was not receiving all the hydration she needed. We did our best in between her naps, but it was not quite enough to keep her functioning. The ER physician, who had never before even heard of my wife, gave us support via outpatient IV fluids for a week. That was all we needed, but it made a huge difference. The ER told us to contact our oncologist, which I did.After 24 hours I received a callback from Doctor Helsten\\'s administrative assistant stating that because she had never seen my wife in person, she did not feel that she was qualified to recommend IV fluids plain hydration and that we needed to seek assistance from palliative care. How can an oncologist who had time for my wife before and knew of her case issues say she is not qualified to recommend fluids for my wife, while and ER doctor who has never met us can be kind enough to help us until we can get support from what is supposed to be our team?While our previous oncologist may not have been the most aggressive, he was extremely supportive, caring, and compassionate- always available by phone or email, and his office understood that when a cancer patient \"urgently\" requires a consult, they are not exaggerating in any way, shape or form.The lack of compassion and care demonstrated by Doctor Helsten should serve as a warning to all potential patients. Look out for your loved ones and consider other physicians individuals who care about treating the person, not just the disease. Find someone who respects the whole human being and understands that they are supposed to be helping someone\\'s son, daughter, husband, or wife, not washing their hands of them when they need support and treatment the most.

       "  \"This review is a little hard for me to write since I have had two very different experiences being a new Kaiser patient so I will start from the beginning.Being a PPOer for life I decided to give Kaiser a chance even though I had been told multiple times that it is a machine and the Walmart of healthcare. I wanted to try it out for myself and see what my own experience would be like vs taking other people's opinions. I did a lot of research on Yelp to read reviews so that is also why I am compelled to write this.Pro's:It is great to be able to email your doctor directly but at the same time many facilites have this feature available. My husband had torn is MCL, ACL and meniscus and had his surgery done at the Hayward facility. The surgeon was great! She had great bed side manner and walked us through each and every step. We only paid $25.00 for the entire surgery which is not bad considering this is his second surgery and the first time around we paid over $2k.Con's:This is why I must give them 2 stars. I have been having severe heart burn and acid reflux issues. To the point where I do not sleep at night and can barely eat or drink anything. During my first visit to Kaiser the doctor prescribed me Prilosec which had the problem under control but I would still have episodes. A couple of weeks ago I had severe heart burn and sharp, unbearable pain in my stomach. I made an appointment right away to see my doctor and she recommended that I take OTC gas-x and pepto-bismol. The next day the pain continued and after almost over dosing on OTC I called the nurse line who let me know the doctor said to keep taking OTC drugs and that it would pass. I finally gave up and went to PAMF in Fremont. Luckily, I kept my PPO as a back up plan because I knew this day would come soon. Upon arriving to urgent care I was give a GI cocktail which relieved my pain almost instantaneously. I was given a stronger prescription to help control the pain until my follow up visit with my new primary care doctor at PAMF. Upon arriving she let me know that I may be infected by H. Pylori and immediately ordered stool tests and blood work. She already has a series of steps ready to go to get to the bottom of the problem rather than just giving me pills to stop the pain. I am very satisfied with the new level of service I am receiving at PAMF.If you are debating whether to get rid of PPO and get on the Kaiser train I would highly recommned against it. Do not do it or live with the regrets or poor quality service from people who do not care about your health care needs but rather saving on cost in any area possible.\",\n",

       "  'First off, let me begin by saying this is the first time that I have ever written a negative review for anything. I\\'ve had my fair share of bad experiences but I\\'ve never been compelled to write a negative review for anything or anyone except in this case for Dr. Jacqueline Okada. This doctor is more interested in going home early than taking care of her patients. On more than one occasion, she left me waiting in her office while she went home at 5 o\\'clock (or 5:30, I dont remember the exact time). Didnt even have the decency to tell her patient that she was going to leave; instead, I had to ask the staff when the doctor would come and see me but was informed that she had just left for the day. What kind of doctor does this? This type of inappropriate behavior aside, I would like to mention that this is nothing compared to her gross lack of integrity as a healthcare practitioner. I was appalled not only by her lack of professionalism, but her incompetence as a physician and outright dishonesty. For months, I had been going to her with a specific symptom but she told me she performed a number of tests and that the tests had come back negative every time so I was fine and that I should simply go home. Its important to note here that she never once took my symptoms seriously and as was evident in her demeanor, she was irritated by my returning to her for the same chief complaint time and time again. My old-fashioned upbringing instilled in me the sense that I was to respect my physician, so I placed my confidence in her but my symptoms grew more frequent and severe over the months until one day I made the decision to try another doctor. This new doctor who wasnt covered under my current insurance plan (and thus I had to pay out of pocket for) was extremely courteous and addressed my complaints with the sincerity and passion one would expect from a professional physician. Some moments later, my lab results come in he (the new doctor) tells me that I should go to the emergency room immediately. Before I leave, he asks me why I didnt come in to see a doctor earlier with these complaints but the truth is I had been seen by Dr. Jacqueline Okada with these symptoms for months and on numerous occasions. If it was genuine incompetence on her part this ordeal just might be a bit more forgiveable but her actions go far beyond the realm of simple negligence. There is just too much pain and suffering that I have endured under (and as a result of) the \"care\" of Dr. Okada and the damage that has been done can never be reversed but I would hate to have another patient become victimized as I have. Therefore it is with great regret that I take my experiences to the internet and write this review. Please, if you have any doubts about Dr. Jacqueline Okada\\'s diagnosis and treatments, I beg that you go and get a second opinion before its too late and you are forced to have an operation like I did.',\n",

       "  'Dr. Richardson is obviously a very intelligent person and I respect him for his accomplishment of becoming a psychiatrist. His style as a clinician, however, was not a match for me. I was referred to his outpatient services after being admitted to a psychiatric hospital for major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation and a mood disorder. During my visit, he was obviously unfazed as I was pouring my heart out to him. He speaks in a very condescending tone and blames the patient for their inability to cope. As I was expressing my feelings to him, he told me that I am confusing my feelings with my thoughts and that he disagrees with my thoughts. I find it disrespectful for a professional to invalidate someone\\'s emotions in such a way, even if they disagree. At one point, he asked whether I had been physically or sexually abused. I had my mother in the room and politely asked her to leave so that I could speak with the doctor alone. After speaking with him alone about some more personal things, and admitting that I used marijuana in small amounts to cope with my mood swings, he told me (not asked) to tell my mother to come back into the room. He then questioned her and asked whether she knew about my marijuana usage (she did). This was actually a violation of HIPAA to discuss my personal health information with someone else without my expressed consent. I am 25 and my own legal guardian. In the end, he vehemently disagreed with my marijuana usage and told me to just stop. Is this the way cessation is taught in medical school? I discussed with him the side effects I was experiencing from the drugs he prescribed, but he would not take any of that into consideration. Overall, I do not think Dr. Richardson is a bad doctor like the other reviews. He just was not a match for me. My ideal psychiatrist would be empathetic, a good listener, and would express himself in a non-condescending manner. I am struggling with a lot, and at times I really do appreciate the non-emotional, tough love, \"I\\'m the doctor and I already know what\\'s best\" approach. However, after being hospitalized for 5 days and experiencing the worst depression of my life, this was not the most delicate way to handle my case. On a positive note, Dr. Richardson is very composed and did not rush my visit. I am grateful because many doctors are pressed for time.',\n",

       "  'I found Dr. Shridharan after reading though some reviews online. Getting an appointment with her office was fast and easy. When I called, I let the receptionist know that my son had Medicaid for his insurance and was told that since he did not yet have an ID number, (he was only a few days old) I would have to pay out of pocket for his visit and that Medicaid would later reimburse me. Assuming that they knew what they were talking about, I paid for his first two appointments out of pocket with money that I had to borrow. I would later find out that paying them upfront and assuming they knew what they were talking about was a BIG mistake! As far as the doctor goes, although my son was seen at her office about four or five times, he only saw Dr. Shridharan once. Every other visit was with her nurse Dr. Matthews. Both were very nice ladies and I feel like they listened to my concerns and advised what they could. Crystal who was one of the nurses assistant or aide was really good. Always very nice and on top of her job. She also always made an effort to make conversation and did what she could to make our child feel comfortable. The wait time was never too long, about 10 minutes at most. I cant really say that I have any complaints about the doctors and cans say too much about Dr. Shridharan because I only saw her once. However, her front staff could use definitely use more training and as a private practice, she needs to up her customer service. To try to make a very long story as short as possible, I was told to pay out of pocket for my sons first two visit and that I would then need to call Medicaid and they would later reimburse me. When I did this, I was told by Medicaid that they do not do this and that I would have to have the doctors office file a claim for payment and that they would have to be the ones to do the reimbursement. When I called Dr. Shridharans office to inform them of this, I was told that they could not reimburse me and that they would not submit a claim to Medicaid. I had explained to them that this all began because of the information I received from them when I first called. After about two weeks of going back and forth with them I was told they would do me a courtesy and file the claim and when they were paid they would reimburse me. I waited a month before calling back to check on it to give them some time, from there I just got the run around. They would tell me it was submitted but they werent paid, then they would say one was paid but not the other. I called Medicaid and was told they were submitting it wrong, then later that it was paid. They would then tell me a check was being sent or that they had already sent it. It was always a different story when I called them. Every time they told me someone would call me back, they never did. I got to the point where I was going to file in small claims court because I was getting nowhere with them. After five and a half months of going back and forth with them, they finally gave me my money back. I believe they only did this because I let them know I was going to take them to court. It was a huge hassle and inconvenience. I write all of this to say, if it ever comes down to it that they have to reimburse you, be prepared to have to fight them and for anyone that may have Medicaid, DO NOT pay them upfront!',\n",

I couldnt walk without collapsing from dizziness, I was extremely weak and wanted to sleep all day. I had pressure and pain throughout my whole brain. I thought I was DYING! When he could have EASILY treated me. I finally found a Doctor who did the same things he did but actually diagnosed me and healed me the SAME day! I missed over 3 weeks of work and 2 weeks due to him. I would ask Marc Toofan and his nurses to start treating people with more compassion and with better work integrity towards their scared sick patients. I have never been through something like that in my life, and I am so THANKFUL I am past it. But I could have been past it MUCH FASTER if he and his nurses would have just done their job correctly! So even though I do not usually do this kind of thing, I have opened up an investigation against this doctor for malpractice. Zero stars for this hospital!\",\n",

However, I did not see the compassion and concern for his patients. I saw him 2 months ago but I failed to bring the right CDs during my visit. I was later able to retrieve them from the hospital and sent it to him. I got the CDs back with no notes or phone call. When I called the office, I was only able to speak to his assistant who could not really answer my questions. I told his assistant I want to speak to him. He called but I was not able to pick up the phone as it was after hours and I was driving. I called his assistant again and I faxed my questions-twice. No response. The assistant said she could only help me on Thursdays. It has been two Thursdays and I still have to get a phone call from the doctor. I am very disappointed.',\n",

       "  'I was referred to Dr Cohen by another physician to evaluate a possible polyp on my vocal cord. The office staff was friendly and I was taken back to an exam room quickly, which I appreciated. There were no other patients in the waiting room, which my experience probably explains why there were no other patients waiting! When the doctor walked in, she immediately asked me when specific symptoms started, which I never had or mentioned I had any symptoms besides a providing a picture from a previous endoscope procedure. She quickly gloved up and next thing I know she was prepping me to scope my throat / vocal cord through my nose. When I asked what she was going to do after she gloved up, I got in a derogatory voice, \"Well, you came to me because there might be something on your vocal cord, how do you expect me to see it without scoping you\". Fine, then explain the procedure before you begin and ask me if I have questions. You may do this multiple times a day, but this was my first time and probably most new patients first time. I also asked if she could tilt the exam chair back a little and I was told \"no\" but no reason why. I believe she intentionally wanted to make me uncomfortable. Geez...basic manners please. I was uncomfortable (but not obnoxious) and she then proceeded to compare me to a three year old patient that she had just scoped and so I shouldn\\'t be complaining and stop being a baby about this. That was not professional and made me feel like a real loser! When I asked her how much longer, she commented \"I will be done, when I am finished.\" Okay! The appropriate answer should have been, \"I am more than halfway done\" or \"just a few more minutes\" in a pleasant tone would have put me or any patient at ease but instead made it even worse. I also had to ask her what to expect after I leave...\"how long will my nose and throat be numb\". This should have been communicated to me proactively. Or, maybe even an information sheet about today\\'s procedure would be helpful. Again, she may do this all day long but it was a first time for me and I would have appreciated more I information. Before I left the exam room, she proceeded to give me a hard time about drinking diet soda. Yes, I understand but she nagged me about it a little too long. Sorry, I am not perfect. Doctors receive a lot of training including bedside manners. It appears to me that Dr. Cohen does not feel she needs to take time to meet her patients, listen or explain what she is going to do. This was confirmed for me with previous patients feedback. While she may be very good technically and has diagnosed serious conditions with her patients, good bedside manners are just as important from the patients\\' view and a good physician has the full package. I am a successful business executive and do not put myself above anyone and nor should a doctor just because of the \"MD\" at the end of their name. A patient / physician relationship should be a partnership .... Speaking and Listening to each other in a friendly and polite manner and deciding together a course of action. I will not see Dr Cohen again nor will I recommend Dr Cohen. I will also let my referring physician know of my experience with Dr. Cohen.',\n",

No explanation as to the others or if or when they would be addressed. I would not elect surgery from anyone this impersonal and who falsifies reports to make himself look so thorough when he was SO brief it makes you dizzy!

He was the rudest \"doctor\" I have ever encountered. His bedside manner and rush to run from the room had me unsure of even the diagnosis. He gave me a prescription which he said to take. When I asked of side affects or what I should watch for, he told me I was stressed and left the room. Well that pill had me at toxic levels within days and back to see another true DOCTOR. I have never felt so strongly that I have ever wrote a rating or felt the need to. Clearly someone needs to say something. Make a clear choice for yourself and do NOT choose this man.

When she was about 48 years old she began to have difficulty breathing and seemed to be coughing more than normal. She told Patterson of her difficulty to which there was no other response than him ordering a hand held inhaler. This did nothing to relieve her difficulties. I tried to get her to go see another doctor but she trusted him and said she would try what he suggested. Over a period of two years she became worse and began having back pain, She was referred to a pain doctor, She began having difficulty walking for which she was referred to a neurologist. Still with no relief she was referred to another pain management doctor. After being referred to approx 5 other doctors and suffering excruciating pain he finally referred her to a psych doctor and told her husband he thought it was all in her head. Three weeks later at the age of 50 she died with cancer with bone metastasis. I know he could not have prevented the cancer, however she could have received proper treatment for her diagnosis which would have not only slowed the progression of the cancer but she would not have suffered as much as she did over the past two years. I feel Dr. Patterson did not perform prudently as a physician in the capacity he occupies. I am a registered nurse and I have not seen such neglect of patient care. He has tried to cover his tracks by saying x-rays did not show anything. The truth is, they indeed did not show anything because he failed to get any x-rays or labs on her. She told me herself she didn't even have any basic blood work done in nearly a year before her death. Shame on you Dr. Patterson. your complacent behavior caused the early death of a lovely person who was loved by many. You should have been sanctioned in some way for your neglect. Her name was Maida (Kippy) Dunn and her husband Pete Duranowski has suffered tremendously monetarily and emotionally.\",\n",

Also the fact that I have received every piece of mail from KP EXCEPT the billing. Those bills were send to an address I had more than 20 years ago!! I would strongly advise when you go to KP for anything except for what the Affordable Health Care mandates, to check what the deductible will be.

I came in Friday 4-29-2011 with a sore throat. I was seen in a timely manor. Being  a new patient  the nurse advised me that I needed to set up an appointment and choose a Primary Care Physician. I was informed that they could take care of that right away. I made it abundantly clear that I did not want to do it at that time. I was hesitant to do it at all not seeing the need. While being examined she was insistent on the fact that I needed it done. I conceded that maybe I should but that now was not a good time and I could come back later in the day or set an appointment for next week.  As the examination went on she repeated how important it was for me to see a Primary Care Physician. The Primary Care Physician could explain the lab work that was in my file.Work that I had  gotten done for my Dermatologist. Again I repeted now was not a good time I had somewhere to be. She took a swab of my throat and said she would be right back. Some 20 min later she stuck her head in and told me that the doctor would be in in a few min. My thought was why am I seeing a doctor for a nurse visit? When the Doctor came in she started to go over the tests I had in my file.Tests had nothing to do with why I was there at the time.  I explained that I was now short on time and had hoped this was to be over soon. She then started to examine me. As she did she joked that \"bet it feels like you are being forced to see a doctor.\" I told her YES it did. She told me that the nurse was concerned for me. After the examination the doctor told me the short test had concluded I did not have Strep and my throat was sore. She did not give me a prescription for anything, nor did she tell me that they do not give out antibiotics for this. She in fact did not give me any advice at all! Just sent me on my way after almost 2 hours in your office.  \\r\\n \\r\\nYour nurse, while thinking she was acting in my best behalf was NOT! I DO NOT need a another mother. She WASTED my time! The doctor that I did not need to see did nothing for me and again wasted my time! I am furious that I spent almost 2 hours in your clinic and only got hassled, nothing productive happened! MY TIME WAS WASTED! What am I paying  for? I was assessed a Co-Pay, I will not pay it! I would like your help to have it removed from my file. \\r\\n \\r\\nI have been a new patient for almost 5 months this is the second doctor I have seen. So far I have had a problem at every turn when I have dealt with your company. When I set up my online access, when I set the appointment for my dermatologist, when I faxed records to your records department, when I faxed records directly to my doctor, having the first of 2 prescriptions filled, Still having problems with the second prescription and now this.

       "  \"When I was pregnant, Gross made me feel like my reasonable questions and concerns were invalid and foolish. He gave me a rough internal exam without using any lubrication, causing me pain and discomfort. I felt violated. When my water broke, he ordered me to the hospital and when there, he told me that it was terrible that my water broke and that I wasn't feeling any contractions, as if it was my fault. He urged me to wait to receive the epidural and when I couldn't withstand the pain for very long, he mocked me for getting it so quickly. He told me I might need a C-Section, but left the room without reassuring me that a C-Section would not be so bad. When I did end up needing a C-Section, instead of comforting and calming me, he told me to pull myself together. The whole time it felt like I was just getting a C-Section so that he could go home to his family BBQ (my son was born July 4th weekend). During his visits to me at the hospital, when I asked about what I was forbidden from doing, he made many sexist remarks about women and grocery shopping. At subsequent visits, each time he spoke to me about my C-Section, he mentioned a different reason. While the reasons were not mutually exclusive, it was strange how he kept changing the reasons for the C-section. He made me feel guilty for being upset about the C-section by saying that my son was beautiful and healthy. While I am very thankful that my son is so beautiful and healthy, I will always wonder whether I truly needed an extremely invasive procedure that had a difficult recovery or if my doctor was just rushing out the door. Because of his terrible bedside manner, he never gained my trust as a doctor. The worst part is, I know women who are his biggest fans, which makes me think that he chose to victimize and bully me in particular. I truly think he is a misogynist who chose the profession of obstetrics because he likes seeing women uncomfortable and in compromising positions.\",\n",

He asked some questions did a little pushing on my stomach, had blood drawn and said they would call with results in a couple of days. That was on Monday, I never heard from them after calling several times and leaving messages with his nurse on Thursday, I finally got a hold of her Friday afternoon. Then she said \"yea I tried calling you Thursday, but there was no answer\". No you didn\\'t, and if you did you should have left a voicemail. I went back in because of more pain in a new area and diarrhea a week later and had lost 14 lbs. which I was told is normal and it was still just the pancreantitis. I went in as a walk in so couldn\\'t see Dr. Kuenstler instead saw Dr. Rodriguez. I was shocked at how much he argued with me when I asked if it could be something else that was causing the pain, and that all of this was new pain, and the diarrhea was new as well, but he stuck to just pancreantitis.. I have to go back to have a third set of blood work done and I\\'m pretty sure I will be finding a different doctor from now on.

       "  \"I got pregnant with my second child and really wanted a lady doctor. With the best intentions I came across Dr. Lacome's name. The Miramar location was something else that interested me. My high hopes were quickly shattered when even a few of the front desk staff were rude to me. Later on I came to find out my doctor was no better. During a visit, she informed me that my Pap smear showed unusual results in the coldest most insensitive matter. At the time I was nearly 28 weeks pregnant and thought that maybe I was being over sensitive and that the sarcastic, aggravated attitude coming from her was in my mind. She was very dismissive of the results and told me to wait until I give birth for further analysis. As it is I have a history of premature labor, early on she'd asked me to let her know when I was 15 weeks pregnant to begin shots that would help prevent this from happening again, but I could not start them due to the outrageous insurance cost. Then I had a scare: I lost my mucus plug. I wasn't sure if it was exactly that at first, though. I thought it was normal fluids from being pregnant. A few days later while reading something online I realized it could be something serious. Worried, I called Dr. Lacome. I reached her on her day off and, once again, she was rude and sounded bothered and aggravated. Over the phone, she said she didn't understand and that she could do nothing for me regarding something that happened 3 days ago. She then ordered me to the hospital. I was released and told nothing was wrong, to just drink plenty of water and not to have sexual intercourse. At my next doctors visit I was to be checked for the abnormal cells found in my cervix as she wanted to see them through a magnifying glass. Instead, she checked and told me she found that my cervix was 1 cm dilated. She spoke nothing of the cells that she had me so worried over. It wasn't until then that she mentioned a more affordable injection, which I went and got right away. The first shot I received, administered by a nurse, was given to me on my sciatic nerve. I've been limping ever since. When I told Dr. Lacome she started up again with her aggravated attitude.She went so far as throwing my chart and telling me to not take the shot then. She had no concern for my hip and was just plain unprofessional. I suggested to try the shot one last time in hopes that it wouldn't mess me up and that I could keep taking precautions it didn't even come from her. She then called in the same exact nurse that gave me the first shot. Luckily, she got it right that time. Fed up with how Dr. Lacome has treated me, I decided to change doctors in the same office keeping my fingers crossed that he'll be different. Unfortunately your actual doctor isn't always the one to deliver your baby, it's the doctor on call so there's a chance it will be Dr. Lacome. I'm really hoping it's not. As a patient, you look to your doctor for help and support. I simply can't understand why she would even pursue a field where she's in a position to help others as she has an awful temper and zero people skills. I wouldn't recommend her to my worst enemy--no expecting mother should be treated the way that she treated me.\",\n",

When I walked into your office for my routine check at 19 years of age, I did not know what was wrong with my health but I told you about the symptoms I had been experiencing. I was gaining weight, losing my hair, constantly tired and fatigued. You felt around my neck and found a 1.6 cm nodule on my thyroid. I remember it like it was yesterday, you said, do you know you have a nodule on your thyroid? At the time, I did not know what a thyroid was or how important and valuable this organ is to our bodies. I know that if it was not for you, there would be a strong possibility I could have went undiagnosed. It was just the day prior to my visit with you that I went to my primary doctors office complaining of the exact same symptoms and nothing was figured out or detected. I was sent to an endocrinologist for a biopsy and found out I had thyroid cancer. I ended up having a complete thyroidectomy followed with the radioactive pill. It took me a long time to fully recover because I could not take synthroid until my body recognized I did not have a thyroid first, then once I started to take synthroid, It took a while for my body to adjust. I will be 28 this year; I want you to know how grateful I am to have you as my practitioner. I have been routinely tested for any reoccurrence, it is always negative. I live a healthy life physically and enjoy watching my daughter grow with each day, Gianna will be 5 this year and you delivered her into my life. I will forever be grateful for your support, encouragement and dedication. I have been inspired by you, and Dr. Feldman to give back to the community the way you do and I hope one day I can work with you as a nurse. You are an amazing physician and anyone who has the chance to be in your care will understand exactly why I feel the way I do. You are one in a million; you will always be the angel who looked after me and my family. Thank you, Thank you, thanking you forever.

The office staff was nice but everytime I went I always had to wait forever and there was always some kind of problem going on!! Pros: The only reason they got one star is because I had to.

       "  'I have been seeing Dr. Harden since 1996. I stopped seeing her in the early 2000s for a few years, due to moving to another city. I came back to San Antonio a few years ago and chose to continue to see her for my annual visits. Seeing a gynecologist is a difficult issue for me. It seems that I\\'ve had a few scares which turned out to be fine however, they were still \"scares.\" Add to that, I am a private person and insecure by the whole visit in the first place. Dr. Harden seemed to be a good person in the 90s. She was kind, positive, and took her time. I still remember after my first visit with her, she sent me a hand written note stating \"it was nice meeting you.\" When I came back in early 2000, she had changed. During the years I did not see Dr. Harden, I had 2 children, was going through major depression, and had gained a significant amount of weight. When saw me again, she noticed I was on an antidepressant. She said \"maybe you just need to see a good therapist and exercise.\" I was floored and began tearing up. I didn\\'t say anything. I was shocked and felt so judged. Little did she know that I was in therapy. Regardless, who is she to judge someone for taking an antidepressant? After that visit, I decided to continue to see her the following year. Yes, this is where I went wrong. The following year, I was still up in weight and she made a point to mention it to me and not in a kind manner I might add. The office has a weight loss program so I know that is an extra money-maker. I realize that I need to be healthier however, when one is overweight they know this is a fact. When someone is overweight perhaps they are struggling with past abuse and food issues? Perhaps a lot has happened in their life and they are indeed working on it. Apparently, Dr. Harden does not see patients who are living in the real world. See this doctor if you are a perfect size, with the perfect life, and no problems otherwise, be ready for judgement. I do have to say that she comes across as an analytic who practices medicine aggressively. I believe she has an anxious, perfectionistic side where she is careful not to make mistakes in medicine. Again, this would have to be an asset as a doctor. If only she could have the compassion necessary, that would make her a true doctor.',\n",

I went through 3 rounds of therapy, took a year off from running and had an MRI done but my results showed nothing wrong. I knew that being 19 pain with every step isn't normal but no doctor took the time to care or understand running is my passion. I eventually found dr leek and what a miracle. I had surgery done and he found 3 problems with my knee and fixed them. I will start running in about another 5 weeks so I am keeping my fingers crossed it worked. But just after a week from surgery I can tell an improvement. Walking is less painful now than before surgery. And you would think tha only after a week my pain would still be high. I am willing to say that if I had a different doctor I would probably be in yet another round of therapy because they didn't take the time to listen closely enough to me. Dr Leek didn't see anything on the MRI but that didn't keep him from trying surgery. I suppose intuition a gift some doctors just dont have, or maybe none of them care about anything than their high paying salaries, but dr leek in my opinion has everything all the other doctors who failed me didn't. As I said I'm still keeping myFingers crossed about running in the future but if I keep recovering at this rate and stray away from pot holes to twist my knee in, I can say this man gave me my life back.\",\n",

He saw me for limited symptoms caused by calcium buildup on the vertebrae, (OPLL), and the resulting spinal cord compression. At the time I had no idea what was going on, and he told me I could become quadriplegic from even sneezing, or tripping and falling, and needed to get immediate fusion surgery. I spent 6 anxiety-ridden weeks, researching the condition, while waiting for a Flagstaff neurosurgeon, Dr. David Sacco\\'s second opinion. I discovered that there is absolutely NO empirical evidence of any kind that someone who has my condition is at greater risk of quadriplegia, and that it is only general, commonly held \"common sense wisdom\" by doctors. The second opinion was to simply keep an eye on the condition, and get another MRI in 6 months to a year, as my symptoms were minimal, and had already gone mostly away after making lifestyle changes, in terms of getting up from sitting regularly, and doing stretches. Doctor Hale and his assistant would not call me back to discuss any of this, even after I called back twice, both times being assured that he would call me. This doctor is really hurting people by creating huge anxiety, that only makes healing much more difficult. He is both unethical and unconscionable in his greedy pursuit of endless $21k operations. He covers himself from liability and sanctions, by using surgery scare tactics in person, like saying that you could become quadriplegic from even sneezing, or tripping and falling if you don\\'t get surgery, but then in the actual written report, only saying that the risk of injury was only \"relatively greater!',\n",

       "  'My opinion is completely opposite from a few years ago. He\\'s great UNTIL you really need help. After TEN YEARS of never missing an appointment and being WAY too honest with him, I asked him to contact a new pain doctor who refused to treat me with opiates because I admitted I had smoked marijuana in the past. I was years past any substance abuse problems and opiates were not what I abused. I had already been on hydrocodone for several years, but fired the doctor who was prescribing it. I made numerous attempts, but Pandya refused to speak to me on the phone. At my next appointment, I took my sister in with me. She was also his patient, nearly as long as I. I asked him why he refused to write the note I needed since I told him *everything* about my past substance issues. He said it was just that we had not discussed it in a long time. True, because there was nothing to discuss. I was sober. The reason I took my sister in with me was to have a witness to my attitude and demeanor. She said I did not seem angry or upset, I spoke in a calm, reasonable voice, and it was clear I only wanted an answer to a question. I made no more requests for the note, dropped the subject and continued as usual with the appointment. Before our next appointments, we both got letters saying he was dropping us because he could \"not provide the level of care required\". What? Suddenly, after a decade we were BOTH too loony for him to keep seeing? What does that say about the 10 years of treatment from HIM? I guess he made us worse. And couldn\\'t even tell us to our faces he was dropping us. Lots of his former patients have said he is a coward and they are right. The pain doctor who wanted the note, upon being told that I had been seeing Pandya for 10 years, told me that they are very good friends. My sister had been seeing that same pain doctor for 10 years and he\\'s a very strict one. Considering my absolute honesty (e.g. telling that I slipped and went on another crack binge), and his own ILLEGAL practices such as prescribing Ritalin to a former stimulant abuser AND giving me 3 prescriptions for it at the same time, dated one month apart. NOT legal on Schedule II meds! He also created some false paperwork so I could get therapy my insurance didn\\'t pay for so it seemed like I was seeing him. I appreciated it, but I think that was probably Medicare fraud. I think he was just afraid I\\'d be just as honest with his good friend and spill his dirty secrets. None of this was bad at all compared to what he did to my adult daughter. She was also his patient for a shorter time. She told him she had had problems with benzodiazapines (Valium, Xanax, Klonopin, etc.) He prescribed her some anyway. She told me she intended to ask him to double her dosage, so I reminded him of her issues with such meds and asked him not to give her more than she was getting. He agreed not to, but did it anyway. About 6 months later, she overdosed (NOT by accident) on the tranquilizers he prescribed along with some oxycontin and alcohol. She was in the hospital for 5 days. Upon her release, he gave her new prescriptions for more Klonopin AND oxycontin! He had no business giving her pain meds at all. She was already getting too many from another doctor. But WHAT was he thinking giving her the very same things she overdosed on? That\\'s seriously messed up. Luckily, she went straight to inpatient rehab and dumped this quack. He could have killed her! His long-time receptionist Louise is always a pleasure to chat with. She is such a sweetie, but also incredibly efficient. Kudos to her for keeping the office running smoothly!

Her diagnosis was for me to have a hysterectomy. Early on when I first went to her she did a balloon ablation but the fibroid did not come out at that point. It wasn\\'t until the eighth month that my body tried to expel it. The fibroid began to crown and I bled profusely. She had me go to her office where she stuck her hand up my uterus and attempted to yank, yes yank it out. No anesthetic, no hospital room, just a room in her office. When it would not come out she told me I needed a hysterectomy. I did not agree, so she requested a scapel from her nurse and she literally cut it from the thread that was holding it, more blood. Dr. Lawton then dropped the fibroid in a beaker (I could still recognize that sound) and showed it to me. When she walked out of the office her nurse said, \"I can\\'t believe she did that!\" She then walked back in the room and told the nurse to give me a pad and off I went. Unbelievable! Too bad I did not go for a second opinion until after the fibroid was out. The second gynecologist told me that doctors make their money by giving hysterectomies and I believe that is what Dr. Lawton wanted to do. He said he would testify in court on my behalf if needed. I felt from day one that she and her staff liked certain patients and I was not one of them.

(A friend of mine, with the same implant but different surgeon, got a personal phone call from the surgeon himself regarding the recall. ) After my previous experience with Dr. Kavanaugh, I was not inclined to see him again. I found another surgeon to do the revision surgery, and this doctor immediately identified the reason that the original implant had never worked well for me: the acetabular cup had been put in incorrectly. This was confirmed by another doctor during a separate visit. (Dr. Kavanaugh always acted as if I were making things up when I said my leg motion was off.) The experience with the second surgeon just served to reinforce how poor my experience with Dr. Kavanaugh was - from the lack of communication, to the poor technique of the surgery, to the haphazard way my incision was closed.

I still get sick to my stomach when I think about my experiences there. I have been going here for the last 11 years. I started when I was 16yo, on my mom\\'s HMO plan. When I was a teenager I went to see Dr. Stasiewicz about a sensitive issue that I didn\\'t want my family to find out about so naturally I was a little anxious. I asked him for an STD screening. He seemed uncomfortable that I was gay, and ended up telling me I had to see a therapist before he would administer any healthcare. Shrug... I didn\\'t know you had to get your mental competency signed off on to get an STD screening. As if I imagined becoming sexually active, and my concerns were illegitimate. There was no compassion in the way he talked to me, treated me, or turned me away, and I feel disgusted to this day about how a doctor ever made me feel that way. I didn\\'t like the doctors office anymore, and I tried not to go back until I was 22 and had an unbearable pain in my abdomen, just this crippling pain. I chose to see another doctor, Dr. Kim, who diagnosed me with some colon disease that apparently occurs in old men, basically he didn\\'t know what he was doing. He did absolutely no tests other than pressing down on my abdomen. For a whole month I was in devastating pain, went in and out of there. Finally Dr Kim gets his supervisor involved, who within 5min of looking at me figured out I had kidney stones. I change my doctor to Dr Biorkman who never gave me the time of day. He would sit down with me for no more than 2 min, and no more than answering/asking 1 question about 1 thing would he then get up and walk out, saying he will be right back. Be right back means be right back, right? To Dr. Biorkman it was his way of ending the appointment, as his nurse would come in and send me home.  I got kidney stones again, and he wouldn\\'t hear it. I decided to just pay the high copay and go to the ER. Infact, I started going to the ER from that point on. Those doctors were absolutely useless! Kidney stones occurred 2 more times after that from age 22-25. I went to Biorkman one last time for a referral to a urologist. He gave me a prescription pad signed \"Referral for urologist\" signed Biorkman. I laughed out loud, who was I supposed to give this piece of paper to? Or was he just giving me his autograph? He did not know how to submit a referral to my insurance nor did he have his nurse bother with finding out. Aside from the big stuff, whenever I asked about vaccinations, diabetes screening, or my options for quit smoking aids, not one doctor EVER discussed those issues. They change the subject and pretended like I never asked in the first place. I don\\'t think they ever knew at any point in 11 years where my health stood in terms of glucose and cholesterol as they never ever ever ever ran a check up out of the many times I was in there and I have the medical records to prove it. For 11 years I thought this was what health care was, until I finally sought out a new doctor. I found a doctor who was independent from any medical groups. She knew how to submit a referral to a Urologist, I didn\\'t have to ask her before she ran blood work to check my glucose and cholesterol levels. To me she is the greatest doctor in the world, but in reality shes just how any other doctor should be. Bristol Park? Did these doctors even go to medical school? They seem more concerned about policy and cost than keeping you healthy. Don\\'t trust this group with your family.',\n",

My husband was disappointed (he really wanted to see the baby) and asked why our friends, who lived in a different state got to have ultrasounds done on every visit.

I\\'ve been going to Dr. Wang for 8 months now. The first appointment was with a counselor (who I though was very nice and attentive) and Dr. Wang came up for the last 5 minutes and diagnosed me with ADHD. From the first time I talked to her it was clear that she had a very strong bias against ADHD and the stimulants that are traditionally used to treat it.

The medication helped a lot but I began to feel very uncomfortable by the way she began speaking to me. As soon as I started the treatment that she was reluctant to start, she started speaking to me in a very judgmental and rude way. She even told me I suffered from Depression after I told her that I had been depressed before and I am positive I am no longer depressed. She put me on antidepressants any way and refused to take me off even if I told her it wasn\\'t doing anything and I didn\\'t want to be on unnecessary medication. Many times she told me that I \"wasn\\'t capable\" of accomplishing things other students were even though I am a very good student and have never failed a course. I started to notice that I started to feel worse and worse after every meeting. She made me start to question my own abilities for the first time and I began to feel depressed again for the first time after being completely healthy for two years.

I stayed only because she was on my insurance plan and the location was convenient. By the last visit she became completely unprofessional. She couldn\\'t find my file so we started the session without it. After a few minutes, it was clear that she had very little clue about who I was. She made all of theses false statements about me and when I corrected her she told me I was arguing with her. (she said i wasn\\'t sleeping enough and I had to remind her that we had discussed 7-8 hours of sleep, which I was getting.) She refused to listen to me and let me say very little. She clumped me in her other patients saying they were abusing their medication and that I would too. She made rash accusations saying I had dyslexia, a learning disability, and an anxiety problem whenever I proved her statements about me incorrect. She had no basis for her rash claims and it was very unprofessional. By the end it felt like she was purposely patronizing me to make me leave. I am never going to her again and I suggest that no one else wastes their time and money. She doesn\\'t treat you as an individual patient and clumps you in with all of her other patients with the same diagnosis. She\\'s obviously had some negative experiences with ADHD patients but it\\'s completely unacceptable that she let that influence the way she treated me even when she couldn\\'t remember anything about me or my case. From the moment I started stimulants she categorized me as a drug abuser and made no efforts to hide her personal beliefs. Unprofessional and Rude.

I came to Gary Alweiss after four other doctors from various specialties had failed to diagnose a condition that caused excruciating pain which lasted for ten straight days and sleepless nights. First I wanted the physical pain to end, and then I wanted to know what was going on inside my body. Having gone through previous blood tests, multiple MRIs, and several hospital visits, I was bothered by as much psychic pain from a lack of knowledge as I was by obvious muscle atrophy and nerve pain. After a thorough neurological workup, this superb doctor told me with total confidence (and correctness): \"You have diabetic amyotrophy. About 1% of all diabetic patients experience these symptoms you have been having. The pain does goes away and repeat attacks are even rarer. In time, with physical rehabilitation you are going to be back to your normal self. Your muscles will get stronger and the peripheral nerves will regenerate.\" I came out of that office feeling that Gary Alweiss had restored first my sense of mental health, and secondarily he was going to guide me back to full bodily health. And that\\'s exactly what happened. His extraordinary diagnostic, his comforting manner and his overall medical expertise were a godsend to me and my family.

Because then, we didn't know if it was decreasing the first medication or adding the second which, again, he did simultaneously.Following this change, my son ended up in a crisis home and Dr. Richardson has YET to return our call. My son was in the home for 4 days. What if he had been in the hospital? To be a doctor and be that unreachable is inexcusable and bordering on malpractice in my opinion.He seems to hate his job at the Mental Health Comprehensive Services Center. Again, RUN away from him or cancel your appointment if you have one. There are better options out there.\",\n",

       "  \"I originally met doctor Tuttlemen in the emergency room. I had terrible pain, and the doctors there called him because they wanted a gynecology expert to help them. He found my problem, and rushed me in to emergency surgery. It was a Sunday evening, and he controlled a surgery robot to take out a huge growth they found. I went to see him and his staff at his office a few days later to go over the results from the surgery and to look at my belly. I was walking the morning after surgery, left the hospital later that night, and never had any real pain. I had some discomfortable feeling in my belly, but little tiny holes he used. Anyway, when I went to his office, the results were the worst possible news. The growth they took out was a cancerous tumor. He called my primary doctor, his nurse practitioner Rich sat with me and explained everything to me again. They both gave me lots of time to answer all of my questions. They answered my sisters questions on the phone when I had he call back. He called my doctor right in the room with me, they got other doctors to help me with the cancer, and I have been cancer free for 8 years now. I had been to the emergency room previously that month, they gave me pain medication and medication because I was throwing up, then they sent me home. This may sound a little strong, but I thank Ron Tuttlemen for saving my life. My sister and daughter go to him. If you have seen other doctors, and they don't know how to help you, or can't find what is wrong with you, I can tell you first hand, I would send you to him, and fast. My daughter is going to have her first baby, he will delvier it, and I will be there. I am alive and able to be there because of him. Thank you to him and his workers who I have gotten to know, and they know my family. They are like family.\",\n",

       "  'I was admitted to North Central Baptist on May 9, 2014 and stayed for 16 days after major surgery. I was readmitted on August 29 for a second surgery. My surgeon said I would be in the hospital for 7-10 days this time. The care took a nightmarish turn for the worse. In an effort to draw my blood, a parade of three nurses stuck me a total of 8 times without success. I waited another hour before a phlebotomist came in and took my blood without a problem. After surgery, I requested adoctor to look at my spiking blood pressure (I have always had perfect BP). For 5 hours I was assured that the doctor was on the way and to be patient. When the shift changed the new nurse said that no doctor had been called. She did not know what I was talking about. She said I would have to wait until the hospitalist made normal rounds. I waited a total of 7 hours to see a doctor after my request. I dealt with snarky nurses and belligerent staff, and I went without any care or visits from staff for up to 8 hours at a time (no vitals were taken - I did not even see a housekeeper). After I was left in my room for 8 hours without anyone entering I finally got a visit from the kid who takes vitals. I asked him if he wasn\\'t supposed to take vitals every four hours and he said \"that is what your call button is for\". I asked him if vitals were now only taken on patient request? He refused to answer me and would no longer respond at all. He turned his back on me as if I wasn\\'t in the room. Some of the staff are worse than others, but the pattern of covering up for others is evident. When I finally saw a doctor on regular rounds (7 hours after my request), the treatment was to give me morphine to shut me up even though I argued against it. After all, a drugged patient is a compliant patient. My blood pressure remained very high and no treatment was provided for its cause. Lastly, due to colon surgery I am supposed to eat and process regular food before being discharged. I told the hospitalist that I had nothing to eat or drink for 48 hours and have not had solid food for over a week as I had no appetite. Her answer? - more morphine. After informing my surgeon of the above issues we both concluded that North Central Baptist was not a conducive environment to healing. He discharged me days ahead of plan so that I could heal at home. I wrote an email of complaint to the hospital president, Bill Waechter. Two weeks later I got a response from a low level staffer basically blowing me off. After this, I have justifiably concluded that patient care is way down on the priority list at North Central Baptist, if it is on their list at all.',\n",

I had a very large, pedunculated fibroid (11 cm) located on the outside of my uterus. The fi broid started out small when first diagnosed years ago and my then OB/GYN suggested watchful waiting. While I had no pain or bleeding with this type of fibroid, I did, however, over this past year, notice that I was having some symptoms that included bloating, the appearance of a lump when laying down, and frequent urination. I heard about Dr. Mackoul while listening to WTOP on the way to work one morning. I contacted the Center and was able to get a consult appointment at the Annapolis office. Because I am 47 years old, and do not plan to have children, a hysterectomy was recommended, but leaving my one ovary. I was very nervous, but Dr. Mackoul was very reassuring and explained to me everything I needed to know. I had surgery at Holy Cross Hospital on 2/16/16. I came home that evening, took a pain pill to help me sleep that night. When I woke up the next morning, I couldnt believe how good I felt. I only used Motrin for the next two days and returned to work six days later on 2/22/16. You cant even tell where my incisions were! All I can say is my experience from beginning to end has been top notch. For women that are told they need invasive surgery, you MUST make an appointment with Dr. Mackoul. You will not regret it.

I had undergone two arthroscopy surgeries previously that did not work and my jaw had started to degenerate. Dr. Franco stated that I would need to have surgery. I come from a family where we never had health insurance nor did we see the Dr. So i was going into this all alone, under my own insurance and still relatively young. All the reviews i read about TMJ surgery where it was invasive suggested that it did not help with pain alleviation. So during a consultation with this almost 40 year old man (he had to be around 40) i naturally asked a lot of questions. If you;re about to undergo a surgery requiring massive jaw replacement through a very evasive procedure and lots of rehabilitation, i would assume anyone would want to know what the success factors are, how many patients he had, how comfortable he felt that it would help, etc. Well he was very very annoyed with the fact that I would dare ask him questions. After our meeting, he proceeded to send me, a person at least 20 years his junior, still in undergrad a very, very nasty letter, I wish i would have kept it to post it here. His letter basically stated that he did not want to render his services to me because i questioned him and he didnt see it as a healthy patient dr relationship. I was so upset by his letter, granted i had done all this research myself and I was doing this all alone, that I never seeked any other help for my tmj issues, fearing that i would receive the same treatment with other doctors. I am now 32 and a lot wiser. Also, my jaw is severely worse. I basically have a big empty mass for my lower jaw. I am more confident now and willing to seek help, too bad it was to the detriment of my health. I would definitely, definitely recommend and plead that everyone stay away from this doctor.

       "  'How do you thank someone for saving your life? I am trying to figure that out, but I will start by sharing my story so that others can be blessed by Dr. Willis. After a year of suffering from long, heavy periods, a nurse at another hospital\\'s ER discreetly told me that I should see Dr. Willis because he save her life. He was pretty much my 5th opinion. In a nutshell, he ordered a pelvic MRA - a test no other doctor even considered - and it identified a blood vessel malformation which required a hysterectomy - a \"no brainer\" of a decision. Dr. Willis\\'\\' \"hunch\" was right, and my life was literally saved by him. He was highly recommended by the woman who performed my MRA as well - she had had uterine cancer and also told me Dr. Willis saved HER life. When I consulted with my OB-GYN prior to surgery, she told me she knew and had worked with Dr. Willis and that \"he was the guy we called in when we couldn\\'t stop the bleeding\" This made me super confident in him performing my operation, which was made slightly complicated by the blood vessel malformation. Do not mistake Dr Willis\\' confidence for cockiness. He has a quirky sense of humor which makes you feel at ease (and as a doctor that deals with cancer patients I imagine you have to have that). He always, always made me feel like I could ask him anything, and he even gave me a hug when he knew I needed one. My surgery was on a Friday and he came to my hospital room both Saturday AND Sunday to check on me. Both before & after surgery he was available to answer questions I had PERSONALLY. For someone who is obviously busy, he makes time to make his patients feel comfortable and cared for. I hope that this review will help bless someone who needs help the way I did. I literally trusted him with my life, and am going to enjoy the rest of my life because of it.',\n",

I waited for almost 2 hours to see the doctor, which I was told was normal and not too bad. My appointment was at 10:00 am, I was in his office from 10:00 to 3:00 pm! After seeing the doctor I waited forever to recieve a \"free B vitamin shot\" and then have my blood taken for tests the Dr. felt were necessary. I assumed the Dr. would be prudent in the tests that he ordered and we did not discuss the specifics of what tests he was ordering. At the end of my visit I was charged $275 when on the phone I was told it would be $160. I felt the office was not very clean, and not a pleasant place in general. Over crowded, under-staffed. What has been most distressing to me is the cost of the tests! $1,200! I do, luckly have insurance and the ultimate cost was closer to $750 but due to deductibles I have paid most of that out of pocket and now the labratory is sending me a bill for additional amounts not paid by my insurance. I cannot believe someone would order so many tests without informing a patient of the potential costs. I have not returned to see the Dr. as I am not interested in waiting 2 -3 hours to be seen and am angry about the lack of communication in the costs.',\n",

       "  \"I will preface this with saying that I typically do not make reviews online (I don't think finding a doctor on yelp or any online site is the most credible way to find reliable care), but I felt it necessary to do so after my experience with Dr. Robbins. My husband and I were referred to Dr. Robbins by our daughters pediatrician after it appeared that her blocked tear duct was not relieving itself. She was 14 months old at the time of our initial appointment. I was very apprehensive about the procedure she would be receiving (and I will just put it out there - I hate hospitals/doctors offices in general). I consider myself to be not easily impressed by health care these days and difficult to please, especially when it comes to the care my daughter receives. From our initial consultation and every appointment thereafter (pre and post operation) and follow up, I found myself thinking how grateful I was that I was referred to see Dr. Robbins. Not only did she explain every bit of information I could ever want to know about the diagnosis, cause and cure for my daughters blocked tear duct - but she took her time with us, reviewing the procedure and answering the many questions we had. We went ahead with the surgery (I was a nervous wreck despite it being such a short surgery - I am a mom after all), and Dr. Robbins was sure to see us before, and immediately after she finished the surgery. At all times, I never questioned Dr. Robbins and knew we were in good hands. We just followed up on Tuesday and she is cured. Everything went just perfectly. I read through the reviews below and was pretty shocked by what I read. I feel like I need to say something about these reviews: 1) Everyone has bad days, reviewers and doctors alike, so that should always be taken into account. 2) THIS IS OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. Doctors have a lot of patients, there are typically long waits - and you should be prepared for that. I brought (to our initial appointment that we were TOLD was going to be 3-4 hours long an entire bag of toys, food, water, milk... etc). I also knew that the time I was scheduled was going to go into my daughters nap time. So I prepared myself for a cranky baby. 3) During each of my visits, I payed attention to the information being told to me and retained that information. I read the materials that were given to me and I did my research online. I seldom needed information repeated because I put my emotions on the shelf and LISTENED. -end rant- Overall, Dr. Robbins was professional, extremely intelligent/knowledgeable, and courteous. As an added bonus, she was always so sweet to my daughter (she has children of her own so she is a natural!). I really could not have asked for more - except maybe that the procedure and visits be paid for! Thanks for everything!\",\n",

       "  'Dr. Cobb is undoubtedly the worst doctor I\\'ve ever come across, and I\\'m leaving this review so that others can be informed as to how bad some doctors truly are. Before I begin, I would like to add that I myself am a primary care physician, and only came to Dr. Cobb for a brief visit while I was in town due to some palpitations I was experiencing. She had no clue I myself am a physician, and here is my horrid experience with this incompetent doctor. First of all, I was seen 1.5 hours after my appt time. I almost got up to leave it was such a ridiculous wait time, but my wife encouraged me to stay since we had already stayed long enough. I agreed and after 1.5 hours I was called back. No apology from the MA whatsoever. As she asked me why I was there, I explained I was experiencing some new onset palpitations and I needed to see my dermatologist. Mind you this is the first time I am seeing Dr. Cobb as I was trying to establish a new primary care physician in the area. The MA took down my complaints and walked out of the room. After another 15 mins Dr. Cobb entered the room. Dr. Cobb entered the room almost 2 hours later looking like she had just woken up from a nap and offered no explanation as to why she was late, no sorry, no apology, nothing. I go on to explain about my palpitations, as well as needing to see my dermatologist for a skin condition I have. I explained I needed a refill on a medication for my psorasis, and I could not remember the name. I explained that the medication started with the letter \"D,\" and which was a Vitamin D derivative. Dr. Cobb without hesitation looked at me and said \"We don\\'t use Vitamin D derivatives to treat psoraisis.\" WHAT??!! Dr. Cobb has no idea that I am a physician myself and completely cut me off and said I was wrong in that there is no such medication. I looked at her with shock and said yes there is, I\\'m sure it\\'s in my file. This lady did not even check and proceeded to tell me she has no idea what I was talking about and that I needed to speak with a dermatologist about that. The medication I was referring to, which Dr. Cobb is completely clueless about, was Dovonex, which is a synthetic form of Vitamin D that is used to slow skin cell growth, flatten lesions, and remove scaling. Without even trying to look up my medications, she completely cut me off and gave me 100% false information and had no clue that synthetic Vitamin D derivatives such as Dovonex ARE used for the treatment of psoraisis. Unbelievable. Now, It doesn\\'t take a genius doctor to understand that if a patient is presenting with palpitations there are some basic tests that must be done to evaluate a patient\\'s systems. These include an EKG, holter monitor, basic blood work to look for conditions such as hypterthyroidism which can cause palpitations, etc. Or how about a quick listen to the hear, lungs, and checking of the pulses which can sometimes show conditions such as A-Fib. Do you think Dr. Cobb did any of these things? NO. Unbelievably she did not listen to my heart, lungs, did not order an EKG, nor did she offer to test me with a Holter monitor which is a 24 hour continuous EKG of a person\\'s heart rhythm. She did absolutely nothing nor did she seem interested in offering me these tests. In fact none of these tests or my palpitations was brought up after our discussion on the Vitamin D medication. Again Dr. Cobb had no idea I am also a physician so her incompetence on the basic fundamentals of being a physician were so clear that at this point I wanted to just leave. In the end I waited 2 hours to see a physician who offered no apologies for being late, cut me off and spoke down to me regarding the Dovonex medication, and flat out told me false information regarding the medication, spoke as if she was completely disinterested in my complaints, and offered no tests to check for my palpitations, and did not even conduct a basic physical exam. Mind you this was my first time meeting with Dr. Cobb, and it was the worst interaction I\\'ve ever had. After only 10 mins she abruptly got up, and said she would be right back. I thought she had left to check something, but to my amazement she was back with my discharge papers telling me have a nice day. WHAT A JOKE! The reviews you see about how Dr. Cobb is great are made up by family and friends, they are false ratings that doctors frequently do to boost their credibility online. Truth is Dr. Cobb is highly incompetent, and if you question what she is telling you her arrogance comes right out. Truth is she was rude, and had absolutely no bedside manners, something which is very important in the field of medicine. Do not go to this doctor if you can avoid. There are many other internal medicine doctors that are truly better, and I was able to find a new PCP who in fact ran blood tests, the EKG, and referred me for holter monitor testing. Something Dr. Cobb had absolutely no clue about.',\n",

I have fortunately never met anyone like Dr. Evensen. The first appointment was for an evaluation of an extremely painful knee. I had a few questions to ask the doctor and after looking at the X-rays, she asked me if I would like physical therapy. She then excused herself to take a phone call. I waited and waited and she never returned. Finally an assistant said she was with another patient and all they could do for me was schedule PT. I tried PT to no avail for over two months and the therapist recommended that I return to my doctor for further evaluation. I was unable to get any appointment for 2 months with Dr. Evensen and wanted desperately to speak or communicate with the doctor to find out what to do for pain relief. She does not (at least in my case) return phone calls or be available by email. The best I could do was reach a voice mail of an assistant who was to call me back. Just to reach the voice mail took me over 40 minutes and the phone rang and rang and I used two phones to finally get the operator to locate an assistant to talk to me. On my request, I then went in for a cortisone injection with Dr. Evensen's PA. I have had two cortisone shots in the past and not only have they helped, but there was just a pinch and pressure and no pain during the injection. This time, the PA warned me she doesn't numb the area and when asked if there would be excruciating pain, the PA responded that she had never had one herself and it depended on my pain tolerance. I have never experienced such pain before, even after surgery, and the PA explained she was holding my leg so I couldn't kick her. My blood pressure went very low and a nurse in the room insisted on getting me food and icing the leg and having me sit until I felt less shaky. She was the only caring person I met.

I don't believe Dr. Evensen even diagnosed my problem correctly and certainly added to my pain and caused me mental anguish. Run, don't walk (if you don't have a bad knee) from this uncaring doctor, who spends next to no time in diagnosing a disorder. Update: In March, I went for a second opinion to Bob Yin, M.D. He ordered an MRI which showed a meniscus tear, which could involve surgery and since Dr. Evensen's only recommendation was to go to a rhuematologist that she recommended as she did not know the cause of my pain and thought perhaps he could help. I cancelled the appointment with the rheumatologist when I was told by Dr. Yin that the situation was orthopedic rather than rheumatological.\",\n",

My PCP wanted me to see a pulmonologist. She did the pulmonary functions test. I also complained of right side pain in my rib cage. She told me it was because of my breast implants and wouldn't listen to me. She told me to see a plastic surgeon. He did not make a diagnosis of the pain coming from my implants, but that I had a bleb and pleurisy, which was very painful. I stopped seeing her immediately because of bedside manner. I lost confidence in her immediately as she was treating my husband and myself. I think she thought I was seeking pain medications. Not true. She didn't even try to find out what was wrong, since it had been several weeks since I had the CT scan. It took me almost 3 months to recover from the allergic reaction from the grass. Started allergy shots and was taken off the meds Dr. Singla had put my husband and I on. So beware. I would think she would be an excellent Dr., but since I have worked in the operating room scrubbing cardiac, neuro and trauma surgery, I know when to seek other medical care. She sort of mocked me. Won't stand for that type of Doctor who is supposed to find out what the problem is and not just assume her thoughts are correct.\",\n",

       "  \"I've always been an athletic and active person so maintaining that lifestyle while pregnant was a goal of mine. I notified my coaches immediately so they could help me to stay safe & smart. I was halfway through my pregnancy before Dr. Brown was recommended to me. I wasn't very happy at the large group practice I was at so I decided to make the switch. What a great decision that was! Having a doctor that understood exactly what I was doing was priceless. Having clear instruction on which movements were okay and which ones weren't made me feel much more confident in the gym. Also, not feeling shamed for being so active was very important. I had Dr. Brown's full support and encouragement to keep it up. Even though I felt pretty sick in the first trimester I was able to maintain my 5-6 days-a-week class schedule up until the day my water broke! I have to admit that it was kind of nice being able to workout everyday and not worry about being so competitive. I was just enjoying keeping my baby and myself healthy throughout the process. If something didn't feel good on a certain day I would listen to my body and change the movement or even cut the workout short if need be. I gained approximately 30lbs throughout the pregnancy and had a very healthy 6lb 11oz baby girl at 39 weeks. My labor was about 15 hours and my body held up great. The nurses were impressed with how low my heart rate stayed throughout my contractions. When it came time to push it probably took less than 10 minutes! My recovery time was quick too. I was back in the gym after I got the okay from Dr. Brown at 4 weeks with a few limitations. I actually hit my pre-pregnancy weight even before that! The extra weight just fell off and I know I have CrossFit to thank for that. I'm so thankful to have had a healthy full term pregnancy and a healthy and happy baby. I will definitely be doing the exact same thing for baby #2 someday! \",\n",

I told them I am not buying anymore products because everytime I visit they try to sell me products or get anymore laser hair treatments.

He completely dismissed it, and would not order it. He said they didn\\'t order MRI\\'s for every person with knee pain. Somehow, that translated that I was asking for something completely inappropriate, and that I was being unreasonable. He finally consented to send me to the Ortho after he said he could send me to the Rheumatologist to deal with my joint. I couldn\\'t believe it. He also said that I HAD to have a fall or something to cause the injury, which if you look on any Orthopedic website you will find to be untrue. He got me a knee brace, asked me if I wanted a cane, came back with nurse to fit the brace and said \"OK? OK, bye bye\" and high tailed it out of there. I work for a doctor, and I know how health care can be. I understand how insurance works and what\\'s possible. I feel he ignored my symptoms, was unreasonably resistant to ordering a test that could actually show why my knee remains swollen and painful, and that he came into the room to get the appointment over with.

Several years before I had been diagnosed with acid reflux which I explained to him. I was in his office no longer than 15 minutes and was told I need a endoscopic procedure to see if there was damage to my esophagus. After having the procedure a nurse talked with me and said I would be call with the results. Someone called but I wanted more indepth information about the procedure and results. I then had to make an appointment to see Dr. Kozlov. Again my visit and the information provided was very brief and minimal in scope. I have acid reflux and when, several months after the procedure, I started having severe esophageal burning/chest pains and during one episode I called his office, talked with his nurse and described my symptoms. Then nurse immediately sent me to the emergency room. His nurse said he was on call in the hospital that day and to have him paged. I asked the emergency room nurse to page to page him but I never saw him and he never checked with me during the 3 day stay in the hospital. Nor has he followed up with me after I was released from the hospital. I have since changed doctors and would NOT recommend him.',\n",

       "  'Dr. Nguyen seems to be an excellent physician, but the administrative part of his business leaves much to be desired. I have been seeing him for 2-3 years due to gout, and he has reduced the incident of flareups to occasionally throughout the year. He put me on an anti-inflammatory, Voltaren, and 40 mg of Uloric which has worked fine for several years. I have had no changes in prescription as all seems to be working properly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2013 I received a letter from Express-Scripts stating that my doctor had authorized a change in my brand name prescription Voltaren to the generic version. On 21 November 2013 my wife had an appointment with Dr. Nguyen and she brought this letter from Express-Scripts to this appointment stating he had agreed to a change to the generic. He stated he had not, checked his records, and wrote a new letter stating the generic was ineffective for inflammation for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI contacted Express-Scripts and challenged their assertion that Dr. Nguyen had in fact signed any such authorization change. After all he told my wife he had not and he wrote a letter \"To Whom It May Concern\" stating the generic was not a valid substitute for the brand name Voltaren. It took several weeks, but the CEO\\'s office at Express-Scripts faxed me a copy of the September 2013 change with Dr. Nguyen\\'s signature! The doctor had simultaneously crossed his wires by confusing the entire matter with a requirement that the generic was N/A in my case while telling the insurer that it was fine to do so! \\r\\n\\r\\nExpress-Scripts will not cover such costs since in writing the doctor had authorized a change to a lower cost and ineffective generic. \\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Express-Scripts would not pay the cost for the Uloric prescription refill unless there was a prior authorization and medical necessity letter on file at TRICARE which is my secondary insurer. The primary insurer had an acceptable prior authorization and medical necessity form on hand but this was insufficient for TRICARE. Dr. Nguyen\\'s staff initially stated that they did not support TRICARE claims. I asked to speak with the doctor after hours or at least someone who could take care of this administrative matter. This was not possible, and I was told I would have to wait 7-10 days for the doctor to get back to this issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring follow up calls I was told that they had received a request from TRICARE for a prior authorization form and a medical necessity form (recall I have been on this same medication daily for more than 2 years) and they would get it submitted. Last Friday, 6 December 2013 I asked to speak with the doctor (I was offered an appointment in February 2014) or someone on staff who could send the proper forms to the insurer, and I was told that the doctor had a signed medical necessity letter available for me to pick up. Their call was at 3:55 PM on a Friday and their office closed at 4 PM. I faxed a letter explaining the above details to the doctor and informed him that at present I am unable to refill the prescriptions he wrote for the same medications that I have been able to fill for the past 2-3 years. I asked for help and to speak with him to clear this up.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, 9 December 2013 I drove to the doctor\\'s office and picked up a letter stating I had a need for Uloric long term and no other medication  would work. \\r\\nI also was handed a letter telling me that I was upset with some of the services the doctor provided and that he had gone \"out of his way\" to attend to urgent matters (gout flare ups with the inevitable pain that he told me always to call and see him about- not more than 1-2 times the past 1-2 years) and numerous letters about medications and other matters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were 0 other matters to my knowledge outside of the issues with gout. The numerous letters were required by the insurer and clearly he or his staff mistakenly issued changes in medications that created a major issue when I tried to pay for the costs for the more expensive prescriptions.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have not had such problems with any medical service provider in the past 63 years. I would recommend the doctor for his medical knowledge, but not his business practice as they were unwilling to attend to matters that I did not create nor wanted. The doctor was unwilling or unable to at least discuss these administrative matters nor his staff. He is after all offering a service for a fee and not in business to do the patients a favor. It is clearly \"his way or the highway\" if one questions obvious administrative errors that make our lives more difficult. All of this began with a simple refilling and denial at CVS due to paperwork...\\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",

If you can deliver elsewhere like Desert Regional or even your home then please do so. I went in to be induced and the \"waiting room\" for mothers getting ready to be checked in was in the hallway of the recovery rooms of the other moms delivering. The check in process was quick and I got a room fairly quickly. The L&D nurses are a hit and miss. The first few nurses were pleasant and reassuring that everything would be OK. Once the shift switched to the PM nurses the whole attitude changed. I brought my own hospital gown that is approved to be used in hospitals and a nurse wanted me to take it off and use the hospital\\'s gown. After I showed her that my gown was hospital grade she said it would be OK for me to use my own and even gave me a compliment on how cute it was. I had a nurse by the name of Mariam who provided me with a pretty bad experience. I requested an epidural and I got one. A few hours later I kept asking the nurse if my epidural was working and she said that it was and that I would not be able to feel anything. Well I was in excruciating pain and requested that I talk to my doctor. I told my doctor that I felt that something was wrong because I could feel everything and I was not sure if I was going to be able to have this baby! She checked me out and she said that someone had unplugged my epidural and that I was receiving no pain medication. My doctor was not happy when she found out what had happened and of course all the nurses in the delivery room said that they did not unplug my epidural. To make a long story only a few of the nurses on the PM shift were pleasant and concerned with my birth experience. The others I felt were there for a paycheck. The nurses in the recovery area were far more pleasant. I understand that nursing is a demanding job and that nurses have to deal with a lot but the few nurses that were helping me showed no concern when I kept asking them why could I feel pain. One of them even said that there was nothing she could do I have to deal with the pain.',\n",

He is professional, friendly, open, and works efficiently to get the job done. Ladies know when I say it can be an awkward experience trying to make conversation from over those stirrups. Dr. Blank has great bedside manner where he'll chat briefly when he enters the room to make you comfy, asks you about concerns, and spends the rest of the exam (with a nurse present) giving you a step-by-step of what he is doing next. There's no feeling awkward or guessing with him. After the exam, there is always a meeting in his office where he talks briefly about healthy lifestyles, then discusses the exam, and asks you about additional questions or concerns. I like these meetings because 1. I am a heavier woman, but the healthy lifestyles discussion is NEVER fat-shamy, just a general overview, especially if blood pressure and stuff are normal and 2. I feel like Dr. Blank genuinely cares when he asks for further questions or concerns. He has also always referred me to good other doctors, if I needed it. Lastly, I just moved to California from DC. Dr. Blank followed up through email about my move to say he could assist in finding another doctor and if I ever had any health concerns, could always reach out to him from afar. It was a very appreciated email and again, felt very sincere. I am going to miss Dr. Blank. A good gyno is worth their weight in gold, in my opinion.

There were two separate issues that I faced with Twin Cities: 1. When I visited the ER for a very bad case of strep throat, it took almost two hours to get anyone to acknowledge that I was there. Finally, a nurse took my temperature, blood pressure and the regular tests. It took another thirty minutes for a doctor to see me. When he finally did, it took him literally two minutes to use a tongue depressor and told me to come back tomorrow if I didn't feel any better. That's it. That's all the service I received. As I visited the payment window, the lady at the booth told me it would be $350, as I didn't have insurance at the time. Talk about a rip off! My symptoms weren't any better the following day, plus with the added weakness, I felt considerably worse. Two days later I visited Twin Cities again with a nearly play-by-play repeat of my first E.R. experience, again to the tune of $350. The only thing that changed is that the new doctor at least had the mercy to prescribe an antibiotic which helped a lot. Unfortunately my experience with Twin Cities wasn't over when I got home. A few weeks later I received a bill for several hundred dollars in inexplicable charges. Nothing was itemized by line, so I called the hospital and questioned the charges. Nobody could give me a straight answer, and this was on on top of the original payment window telling me I owed nothing else and wouldn't be billed beyond my initial payments. It turns out that Twin Cities parent company Tenet Healthcare has been involved in numerous class-action lawsuits for shady billing practices. I never did get a straight answer out of the hospital, then Tenet turned me over to ruthless collection agencies to collect the bogus charges. After a year-and-a-half, I was able to dispute them and remove the items from all three credit reports, because they never had documentation to justify the bills. Use this hospital as a last resort, but only if you are dying from a mortal wound.\",\n",

However, for the ovarian cancer, I had to wait almost a month for the final pathology report, and then had to try to get hold of him for two days after it came back. He did not explain the report to me very well (I had more questions than answers when he was done) and he brushed off questions about whether I would need chemo or radiation. He told me I could take HRT to relieve symptoms of menopause, whereas when I got a second opinion later, I was told that was not a good idea because ovarian cancers can be hormonally responsive. I was not overly concerned with a lack of bedside manner, that doesn't bother me, but lack of communication does. I agree that he seems mainly concerned with performing surgery rather than treating cancer. I went for a second opinion at UVa and will be going back there for my (hopefully last) surgery - to remove the ovary that Dr. MacKoul should have removed in the first place.\",\n",

       "  'Kaiser started my induction on because of my pregnancy induced hypertension by inserting a balloon into the uterus to irritate it naturally and start contractions. The only advice the nurse gave me was that, should the balloon come, it would mean I was about 5 cm dilated and to throw the balloon away. She did not indicate whether or not I should come in to the hospital. I feel patients should be advised that they ought to absolutely proceed to Labor and Delivery should their catheter come out, because 5 cm is serious - especially in a high risk patient like myself with a preemie baby. The nurse sent me home, and around 10:30 p.m., the balloon came out. Because I was in extreme pain, vomiting heavily, and pouring blood, I called the Labor and Delivery triage line and they told me to go to Kaiser Sand Canyon immediately. As we were leaving, a nurse from Sand Canyon called and told me the Irvine hospital was full and to go to Anaheim. I couldn\\'t make it that far - and was scared of the risk due to my child being a preemie, my high risk pregnancy and the severe amount of blood loss. In hindsight, it shocks me that a nurse would tell me to drive an additional hour to a hospital I have never visited due to overcrowding. As a high risk patient, I believe I should have been advised to go to the nearest hospital for medical attention. It frightens me to think what might have happened if I would have followed her direction as my labor advanced so rapidly and there were blood pressure and fetal distress issues. Once I arrived, I was placed in a triage room and the same nurse I spoke to on the phone (who told me to go to Anaheim) spent the first hour of my labor lecturing me about how I should have done what she told me because my room would have been nicer and she was swamped. She seemed extremely agitated that I was there, and refused to give me anything for my pain until the admission process was completed, though I was literally on all fours screaming. Rather than hurry up with the admitting process, she kept lecturing me about my poor decision to come to Irvine and how overburdened staff already was. I was transferred to another triage room once the midwife checked my cervix and said I was ready for an epidural. The nurse tried to start an IV and it blew out twice. She complained about how empty the room was - there was no gauze - and asked if I could believe she had to use a washcloth to stop my arm from bleeding. She used this as another example of why I should have listened to her and gone to Anaheim. It scared me that the delivery room I was in did not have the appropriate medical basics to care for me (like gauze). Once a second nurse was able to get an IV inserted successfully, they both failed to remember to hook the IV up to the actual fluids. My own mother, herself a labor and delivery nurse, arrived and offered to help hook up the fluids. When the nurse heard this, she announced she hated having fellow medical professionals in the room because it made her feel judged, and physically turned her own name tag around so we couldn\\'t see her name. Because of the delay in getting the IV hooked up to the fluids, my baby only got one dose of the required four to treat a medical condition. My mother also noticed that the fetal monitor was flat with no accelerations, and that there were decelerations during the peak of two contractions, and the nurse did absolutely nothing to respond. My mom suggested putting me on oxygen and turning me on my side, as my blood pressure was also skyrocketing. The nurse snidely said, \"Oh wow, the grandma doesn\\'t seem to be too happy with the strip!\" And made a rude expression. During my labor, the nurse kept announcing that, \"The baby\\'s strip looks horrible!\" And then would do nothing to respond. Her comments terrified me. When she went to check my cervix, she said, \"Oh wow, you\\'re losing so much blood. I don\\'t want to go near this, I\\'ll go find someone else to do it,\" with a tone of complete disgust in her voice. I also asked the nurse for water over and over during labor, and wasn\\'t given any for HOURS. I had to ask THREE TIMES. I also asked for a Motrin after birth, and wasn\\'t given any for HOURS. Because of this nurse\\'s decision to waste time lecturing me and failure to hook my IV needle to the fluid bag, I had to deliver with absolutely no pain medication. This was extremely traumatic for me. When I was screaming that I needed to push, the nurse said I just needed to get my breathing under control and to quit being dramatic. My mom had to demand she go and get a doctor, because she just stood around rolling her eyes at my screaming. After birth, I has to ask to do skin-to-skin with my own baby. Despite all the preaching from teaching staff about how valuable this is, the nurse failed to suggest or help me with this. I had to ask her numerous times to have skin-to-skin with my newborn.

Since we couldn\\'t get into his Derm or Primary Care Dr we went to the ER. My son\\'s father was there to check him in. I was on my way there from work. I arrived about 45min after he was checked in. The rooms are ridiculously small and uncomfortably outdated. I can overlook that. What I can\\'t overlook is the bedside manner of the staff. The nurse\\'s eyes practically rolled out of their sockets when I started asking questions. I wanted to know what the doctor thought of his skin. Was it infected? Maybe staph? Does he need a blood test? After giving me a hard eye roll she mumbled that she was going to get the Dr ( I think that is what she said) and be right back. The Dr was horrid. She was condescending and totally unprofessional. She shot down every request I made and talked to me as if I was stupid for even thinking that he needed a blood test. \"his vital signs are better than anyone else on this floor\" & \" staph is on everyone\\'s skin\" in her best condescending tone. We left with feeling no compassion from anyone in that hospital except maybe the coordinator that had no problem taking my $150 co/pay. The charlatan sent us with a few scrips. Upon researching the scrips i realized she prescribed something for his skin that was completely wrong and nothing close to what was going on. A few days later we got into Phoenix Skin Derm and the dr there told us that yes in fact his skin was infected and they prescribed the correct antibiotics. If you have no experience with an area of health then ask for a second opinion by another doctor or at least show some compassion. WOULD NEVER GO BACK!

       "  'Last year, on August 30, 2010, I went to Weiss Hospital for a sexual assault exam in the ER (sorry- big TMI, but this is serious). The previous night, I believed I was drugged at a party & was unsure as to whether I had been assaulted, but suspected this was the case. I was given Weiss\\' location & name by a representative at the Rape Crisis Hotline. I drove to the ER at Weiss, and spoke with nurses, police, and a doctor assigned to my case. A nurse had photocopied my insurance information & given it to the doctor. When he found out why I was there, he tore up the paper and threw it away, telling me, \"See? We won\\'t even keep this here.\" I spoke with a female police officer, who said that given the medical information provided, I had grounds for filing a police report, but that doing so would be a waste of time because the statute of limitations would run out before the state even got to my rape kit (since I don\\'t have a perpetrator\\'s name or DNA evidence), and that it would put me in \"the system\" as a rape victim. This dissuaded me from filing a report, and I simply waited for my STD test results & really, really wanted to go home. Upon being discharged from the ER, I was given customary paperwork, and something to mail to Lisa Madigan\\'s office. I received no instruction regarding this paper, but assumed it needed to be completed, and I completed it to the best of my ability with no police report, no perpetrator\\'s name, and no hospital bill (as I had been informed that ER services for rape examinations are of no cost to the patient, and I had received no bill, AND the doctor had torn up my insurance information). Therefore, I was not concerned when, in January, I received a letter from the Attorney General stating that my \"claim\" had been denied due to lack of police report (as noted, I had been informed BY police that this would be a \"waste of time\"). That claim denial was fine with me; I wasn\\'t really asking for any compensation; I filled out the paperwork because it was given to me and I thought it was mandatory. HOWEVER, today, nearly one year later, I received a bill for $430 for \"emergency room services\" from Weiss Hospital. I was dissuaded from filing a police report by a police officer at the hospital. No advocate from the rape crisis center met me at the ER as indicated over the phone when I called, and I received no communication whatsoever from Weiss, much less a BILL, until today. The Attorney General denied my \"claim\" (for good reason, given there was not even a dollar amount to claim until today), and the hospital is asking me not only to revisit this memory, but to pay $430 for my rape exam. It is my understanding that IL-DHS is to pay the hospital if a sexual assault exam \"claim\" is denied by the Attorney General, and the patient wishes to maintain confidentiality by not filing through insurance, OR does not have insurance. I cannot explain how horrible I feel. I\\'m trying not to get overly emotional, but I would have just gone to my own doctor and forfeited my confidentiality/insurance notification if I\\'d known this was going to cost me $430 and follow me over a year\\'s time. I also would have filed a police report if I\\'d been informed that it impacted my ER treatment costs, and if I hadn\\'t been told by the police officer that my rape kit would be a waste of time and humiliation, and that the kit would basically sit on a shelf \"downstate,\" and would \"not be examined before the statute of limitations is up.\" As a social worker and human rights advocate myself, I am outright disgusted with Weiss Hospital, and with the Chicago Police Department, for the manner in which this situation was handled. I will be addressing it legally first thing in the morning, and I hope this does not happen to other women (or men!) in the future.',\n",

       "  'I arrived at this emergency room short of breath. I was alone. I filled out a form with the following information..I am not a Kaiser Member, but was 20 years ago.First/last name, social security number, address, phone number, date of birthBonus points for the receptionist handing me off to the triage nurse right away for an EKG. This was the only real thing they got correct.Five minutes after the EKG, the nurse asked if I had a different last name. I said \"Yes, my married name from 20 years ago.\" They had me as my married name in their old records. I told them that my legal name had been changed in 1994. I explained that I was no longer married, and had not used that married name since 1994. I explained that all of my insurance paperwork is under my legal name, not my married name. They nodded, said they would change it. I was given a bracelet showing my married name as they \"could not change my last name as I was not a current member.\" I was asked what medications I was currently on, I told them. The triage nurse appeared to be typing them in, but they didn\\'t show up on my discharge paperwork. I was never asked about allergies nor was I asked to sign paperwork to authorize treatment before I was discharged. I was never asked for emergency contact information before I was discharged.   Think about the above paragraph. I entered a hospital emergency room with pressure on my chest, and short of breath. They admitted into the emergency room for treatment under a last name I have not used in 20 years. They had no updated emergency contact information for me. They did not have recent allergic information.    If I had died, they would not have been able to locate my family other than by going to my address. I didn\\'t even authorize the doctor to treat me by signature so they would have no proof I had consented to be treated. They would no doubt have filled out my death certificate in a non-legal name, which would have made a mess for my family trying to close out my estate. The doctor handed me a prescription in my married last name. A last name I haven\\'t used in 20 years. A last name that does not match my insurance card so filling the prescription would be out of pocket, not covered. For that matter, when they submit the insurance claim for the visit, they are going to submit it in my married last name. Which means it is not likely going to be covered. Which means a covered visit will be billed to me instead of being paid for insurance. I was asked at the time of discharge for my emergency contact information. I was asked to sign to authorize treatment at that time also. I stated it was a little late to ask for that \"now\" when I had already been treated. I was told that it was standard operating procedure to do it that way. Be warned folks, this hospital was efficient at treating my ailments, but the paperwork side left a lot to be desired. I am still fighting a week later to get them to update my records to reflect my correct last name. They appear unable to figure out who is in charge of doing that.',\n",

       "  \"I've always been an athletic and active person so maintaining that lifestyle while pregnant was a goal of mine. I notified my coaches immediately so they could help me to stay safe & smart. I was halfway through my pregnancy before Dr. Brown was recommended to me. I wasn't very happy at the large group practice I was at so I decided to make the switch. What a great decision that was! Having a doctor that understood exactly what I was doing was priceless. Having clear instruction on which movements were okay and which ones weren't made me feel much more confident in the gym. Also, not feeling shamed for being so active was very important. I had Dr. Brown's full support and encouragement to keep it up. Even though I felt pretty sick in the first trimester I was able to maintain my 5-6 days-a-week class schedule up until the day my water broke! I have to admit that it was kind of nice being able to workout everyday and not worry about being so competitive. I was just enjoying keeping my baby and myself healthy throughout the process. If something didn't feel good on a certain day I would listen to my body and change the movement or even cut the workout short if need be. I gained approximately 30lbs throughout the pregnancy and had a very healthy 6lb 11oz baby girl at 39 weeks. My labor was about 15 hours and my body held up great. The nurses were impressed with how low my heart rate stayed throughout my contractions. When it came time to push it probably took less than 10 minutes! My recovery time was quick too. I was back in the gym after I got the okay from Dr. Brown at 4 weeks with a few limitations. I actually hit my pre-pregnancy weight even before that! The extra weight just fell off and I know I have CrossFit to thank for that. I'm so thankful to have had a healthy full term pregnancy and a healthy and happy baby. I will definitely be doing the exact same thing for baby #2 someday!\",\n",

If you can\\'t believe anyone could rate her only 1 star, then maybe you should read about their experiences, and don\\'t be surprised when it happens to you. First and second experience, 5 stars. Although my husband and I were absolutely devastated to find that our baby had no heartbeat at almost 12 weeks pregnant, and that I needed a D&C, Dr. Reimnitz was very compassionate and guided us through the whole process, calling to check up on me after the procedure.  Third experience, zero stars. Unbelievable. I went in for my one week follow up appointment post d&c, by myself since my husband had to work. I was put into a room with 3 full bulletin boards of cute newborn baby photos. Since I had just lost my baby it was really hard to look at all of those beaming faces, by myself, and not cry. When Dr. Reimnitz came into the room she looked at me and said \"How are you doing\". I said \"As well as I can I guess\" I had pretty much been crying for a week straight after losing my baby. She basically insinuated that it had been a week since the procedure, and that I should be feeling fine by now, not emotionally devastated like I was. She said that it just meant that I could be pregnant again soon and be seeing her again for OB care. She asked if I needed \"help\" as in psychiatric help, because obviously my mental state was not a normal reaction. She performed the exam and told me to come back for my annual, and to call her if I needed to \"see someone\". Really? One week after losing a baby that I had been carrying for almost 12 weeks I\\'m supposed to be just hunky-dorey? Like nothing ever happened? And, I\\'ll be able to get pregnant again after 2 weeks and come back to see her? Let me add that Dr. Reimnitz still had this attitude and false optimism with the knowledge that it had taken me 4 years to get pregnant, that I was 41 years old and had been through 10 fertility treatments. Miraculously this was a natural pregnancy and I was nearly 100% certain that this miracle wouldn\\'t happen again based on my age and experience. Guess what. It\\'s been one year, and I have not gotten pregnant again. Big surprise. The pregnancy loss was obviously not her fault. The condescending attitude, false, inappropriate optimism and cold hearted response to my agony over my loss just added to my grief.  From my own experience and reading the other reviews it seems that you\\'ll have a great experience with this doctor if you have a normal, uncomplicated pregnancy and she can happily deliver your baby. If you have questions, concerns, emotional pain from a pregnancy loss, or, as others have stated, you\\'re overweight, you can expect to be treated like less than a person.',\n",

I pray that people do their research before choosing any doctor and that even if this review helps one person prevent becoming a victim of Dr. Pearson, then my time is well spent.',\n",

       "  'Hello Kaiser Ontario, I have been a very satisfied and thankful member of Kaiser for many years because you are the best and every representative also shows great class and courtesy and true concern to help to little details. Many times I have purchased a little something from your gift stores for family or friends in your care Each time it was a heartfelt experience with your attendant when my order was taken and the love was shared to those who were in need of a little comfort. Except this time, I called the Ontario Store and that is where the bad experience started but I went along with the purchase and schedule for delivery. I even told my wife today the day after when we passed the store to visit our loved one, about the total lack of compassion. Sure enough the little monkey and balloon I purchased was dropped off with no card as to who it was for or where it came from. No one knew anything just saying someone came in and left it. I would like to bring to your attention, your gift store attendant displayed shallow indifference. To me a gift store is a collection of feelings that are shared for a many variety of emotional needs and it could be handled with this in mind. thank you',\n",

       "  'My 81 year old grandmother recently broke her hip and required emergency services at Hayward Kaiser. She went to emergency Sunday morning and was advised by the doctor in the late afternoon that she had broken her hip.We waited and waited for the doctor to give us an update but it was like pulling teeth. They said she will need surgery and they were going to do it that day however they did not perform the surgery till late afternoon the next day.The doctors and nurses never kept us informed of what the plan was and so we had to keep asking them consistently. The next day after her surgery I came and visited in the early morning to see that there were BIG bruises on her left and right arms. I questioned the nurse and she told me oh it was because of the IV\\'s that were put in her. I have included pictures in this Yelp review and you tell me do the bruises appear to be caused by an IV? I certainly don\\'t think so. I spoke to the charge nurse and the nurse manger and they said they will investigate however I have not heard anything back and it has been a few days already. The days following the recovery my grandmother complained about the nurses not being receptive to her needs. They neglected to offer her something to eat at night, did not help her reposition herself in bed and mishandled her. My family members take shifts during the day and evening the to spend time with her but at night my grandmother is there alone and that\\'s when the nurses neglect her because none of us are around to keep an eye out. Today I went to check on her and they were all wearing mask to protect themselves and I was thinking to myself now why are they all wearing a mask. Her nurse even came into the room and did her thing and never mentioned to us that we needed a mask. Another nurse for another patient came into the room and said \"should you be wearing a mask\"? By that point I was PISSED. My grandmothers nurse did not even notify us that we should be wearing a mask. Apparently my grandmother might have TB and so anyone who comes in contact with her must wear a mask. I demanded to speak to the manger or a patient representative to address the issue of not informing the family members of the precaution. The charge nurse came to speak to us and agreed the nurse should of advised us that we needed a mask. So now my mom and I have been exposed to TB. Kaiser does not have a patient representative on site to address complaints but they give you the general Kaiser number to call and your suppose navigate through it to find someone to complaint to. By this point I am outraged by the dismal performance of the hospitals nursing staff. By far this is the worse Hospital I have been to. If my grandmother was not on HMO I\\'d take her out of her so fast because who wants their grandmother to suffer with health care professionals that disregard to their patients!',\n",

       "  'I have a severe deviated septum that is to this day only more exasperated and not any better thanks to Dr. Lubka. I was referred to Kaiser\\'s \"best\" ENT doctor in 2006 to correct my septum and thus allow me to finally breath through my nose regularly and not get asthmatic when trying to sustain a high heart rate due to poor air intake. I had such high hopes after my initial consultation with Lubka. She sounded completely confident, if not a little overbearing, in her assessment and general diagnosis for approaching a corrective surgery strategy to which I should have paid much more heed to. To my utter dismay and horror, I came out with having had an experimental procedure of my nostrils being cut, widened, and flipped to theoretically allow more air flow, along with much \"scrapping\" inside the passages. HOWEVER, my septum, the bone structure that is detrimentally deviated, remained unaltered...no attempt to straighten was attempted! In addition, she unbelievably botched up the routine stitches that were importantly reattaching my nostrils to my face! During recovery, there was a major gap in my right nostril where it met the skin that I immediately made an appointment and drove the hour and half to Kaiser\\'s elite LA hospital where Lubka only worked to address. I specifically told her and showed her my many concerns that were already visually apparent with the stitching, as well as the uneven nostril alignment reattachment, and she said that my skin would heal together right on its own over her \"handy work\" and that she was trying to balance my two sides of the face better by noticeably raising my left side so it would look more symmetrical. Suffice to say, five years later, my breathing is more congested due to the inflammation around the nostrils and inside my nasal passages and my deviated septum left unfixed. My nose has very apparent and terrible looking scar tissue that is not even in a decent line, with that indented section on the right side, or as my husband says, the gapping hole. Lets not get started on the askew placement of the nostrils that has thrown off my entire features and not balanced anything. The extensive trauma to the nostrils constantly hurts and itches and I am left still trying to save for a reputable, skilled, and practiced plastic surgeon to actually FIX my deviation and now my horrible looking nose that has definitely wounded my self confidence from the perspective of a wife and wanting to take any pictures. I cannot stress enough how much I regret having Dr. Lubka even get near my nose, let alone attempt surgery on it. I should have sought out a true professional and sacrificed out of pocket to avoid a world of hurt and disappointment to then only have her tell me post-op that my family, friends, and I were all being vainly critical and my \"phantom pain\" would go away and breathing increase as time went on. She was short, defensive, unwilling to discuss, and critical for her shortcomings. Her true colors came out to late for me, but hopefully this heartfelt review can spare another!\\\\[]',\n",

So, I wanted to share my recent experience for those who are like me and look for reviews prior to scheduling. I made an appointment for my 4 year old son and I admit I was a little hesistant to do so after reading a few of the reviews about the wait time. However since he was highly recommended from a friend who took her toddler there, I went ahead and scheduled and I'M SO GLAD I DID! Dr Roan and his entire staff has been so nice, especially his Medical Assistant Kim! From the moment you enter, the office is very inviting for both kids and adults. There is a children's section with toys and an animated movie playing. For adults without kids who want to want to be somewhat away from there, the waiting area is large enough and have chairs to where you can relax away from the kids area. The front desk staff greeting me with a smile and never appeared rude. THE WAIT TIME WAS NOT LONG AT ALL! I maybe waited 20 minutes in the lobby and about 15 minutes in the exam room. Dr Rohn is nothing short of AMAZING! Upon entry to the exam room, he engaged with my child, smiled, and made my child at ease. He took his time to examine and explain everything to me and answer any questions that I may have had (and I had questions). I never felt rush and came away feeling that he truly cared and was knowledgeable in his profession. He ensured I understood before completing the visit. So after the visit, we had some next steps and that's where Kim comes in! Kim, his medical assistant is so patient and nice! I have had several follow up conversations with her (as we prepare for my son's procedure). The times when I've left her a message, she follows up within hours of the same day. One time, I even apologized for reaching out so much, but she was always welcoming and said she understood. I'm still interacting with him and him wonderful staff but wanted to take this time do a review from my visit and interaction with this week. I HIGHLY recommend if you are looking for a trusting place you can take your child (or yourself) that will give you accurate diagnosis and an overall great experience!

He looked at them and then scheduled me for surgery. He did not tell me he thought anything was suspicious. When I was waking up from my anesthesia he told me he thought I had cancer (a sarcoma). I was floored. During my post operative appointment he told me I had to have surgery again as soon as possible to get a margin around the tumor. I asked him if he thought I had cancer before he cut me open and he says YES! I was so angry that not only did he not feel the need to tell me this, but he did not do a biopsy or scans. Thus resulting in two surgeries. I have no had a recurrence and upon further research into my specific rare tumor, found that he never should have cut me open in the first place. I am generally a very calm and forgiving person but this is something I am having significant trouble getting over. I now have mesh in my abdomen that causes me pain every day.

He has never examined me, ever. 3. When I told him a generic of my medication caused problems, he never asked what. He just wrote a prescription for the name brand. 4. At EVERY appointment, he comments on how old I am. Last appointment, he asked how long my parents had lived so he could calculate how much longer I would be around.

I\\'m athletic and I\\'m always moving around. My breasts kept me from doing so many things that I loved. They caused major back pain, not to mention insecurities.\\n\\nI went to Dr. Perez and I told him how I wanted them smaller than what other doctors deemed normal or appropriate for my size. He listened to everything I had to say and he told me his thoughts. He talked to me about proportion and wanted to make sure I understood everything before I made my decision. I told him I was sure, and he said \"okay\" with a smile on his face. No lectures, no nothing.\\n\\nHe made thorough notes on everything I wanted so that he could refer back to it the day of surgery. He also wanted me to tell everyone that would be in the surgery room my requests as well, so that everyone will be on the same page.  The morning of surgery, I did exactly what he said..

More over the out patient therapy works hard to make sure that their patients are comfortable. A great example of this is when they offer coffee or hot chocolate, my favorite, this to me was priceless because, there were times when I came in soaking wet from freezing rain or freezing because of the cold weather outside. The hot chocolate helped me settle down. Vivian would offer towels for me to dry myself. I'm so grateful for everything she's done for me. I still can't believe I'm graduating from therapy.

When I arrived at the office, my mind went right back to thinking this was a gimmickthe waiting room was full!!!\\r\\nI filled out my paper work and just kept thinking this was a waste of my time. In about\\r\\n20 minutes a very friendly nurse called me back to an exam room; she asked a few questions then asked if I had any concerns. Before I could answer her, Dr Mirando came into the room.He thanked me for coming in today and asked if I had any spots that I wanted looked at. He made some small talk while he looked at my back, and then told me\\r\\nthat he saw 2 spots (not one) that needed attention. He told me to make an appointment and they would see me in a couple of weeks. Again, he thanked me for coming in and left the room. The nurse went over some papers with me and told me not to forget to make the appointment. T o my surprise, everything went pretty quick and I was able to make an appointment within 2 weeks. At my next appointment, I was greeted by a different nurse who was also very nice. She could see that I was nervous and told me that everything would be fine. Dr. Mirando (Bill) entered the room and could also tell that I was nervous about this procedure. He started to joke around with me and before I knew it he was doing the procedure. He stitched me up, told me the nurse would go over the instructions to care for the wound, and they would have the lab results in a week or two. As he was leaving he thanked me again for coming in said God Bless and walked out. Wow, he was very quick and to the point but I felt comfortable during the whole procedure.\\r\\nSo, within the time it would have taken to get an appointment else where: I was able to have 2 procedures done ( both spots came back as precancerous) and follow up appointments to insure me they got all the bad cells and that I was fine. \\r\\nWhat a great doctor!

       "  'I went in as a new patient for my annual exam because I am new to the area. The nice thing was that I was able to get an appointment quickly and the doctor was able to see me the following week. Everyone at the office was nice, but the doctor gave me about 2 minutes of her time to do my exam and left the room. She never asked a question about my medical history, did not see if I had any questions (which I did because I was curious about changing my normal prescription) and did not have the discussion a OBGYN should be having with patients when they go visit a doctor once a year. I was shocked the doctor did not take the time to talk to me at all and rushed through the exam. The point of me getting the exam was so I can get a refill of my prescription. 2 weeks after my exam I did not hear anything and still had not receive my prescription. I called the doctor\\'s office to see why nothing had been sent and they instantly blamed it on the pharmacy. Later they realized they made a mistake but tried to cover it up saying I was supposed to send it in (I specifically asked them if everything was done before I left the doctor\\'s office that day to make sure I did not need to send in the prescription myself). I provided them a new pharmacy location near me to send in the prescription so I could pick it up. It has now been a week and I go to my pharmacy today to only be told nothing STILL has been sent in. Above everything, no one from the office called me with my exam results. When I called in to get my results, the receptionist said \"No news is good news\". I think if you are taking an exam, you have a right to have someone call you and tell you your results as they said they do. Dr. Aronson seemed nice but I will be finding another doctor for the future.',\n",

       "  \"Dr. Braswell is laid back and funny. Those are the pros. However, office visits require long waits. I've never been there and waited less than 45 mins... I don't think I've ever waited less than an hour. That's JUST for vitals. After vitals you go back to the waiting room and wait some more. Finally, you're put in a room where you, again, wait some more. At LEAST another 30-45 minutes. I switched to Dr Braswell during the last two or so months of my pregnancy because I wanted a doctor who I could get comfortable with. Where I was before rotated doctors and so there was no guarantee as to who would deliver me. I expressed this concern. However, I soon learned there was no reassurance at Dr Braswell's office either. My first experience at her office was that I got there and was told that she was out on delivery. I waited several hours for her to get back . My second experience was that she was on vacation and I was being seen by the PA. There was another occasion where I came in and was told that my appointment needed to be rescheduled because she was out doing a delivery. However my question is why didn't the office staff call me before I left work early and came all the way to the office? The times I did actually see Dr Braswell she was pleasant enough but always seems to be in a hurry. She would answer questions but it always felt like she was answering them with one foot out out the door. Sometimes she literally was walking toward the door while answering. Not to mention one time when she gave me results from a test they did and seemed to blaze over them while verbally implying that I already knew them. How would I have? I even had to be the one to ask about the results. Had I not I wouldn't have found out important info about my pregnancy. I had to ask about everything. How was my urine sample? How is my bp? Where I transferred from they told me everything they were doing and so that's what I was used to. I think Dr. Braswell is too busy. Part of this could also be because the office only seems to open Monday through Thursday. Is this the norm for private practices? Doesn't seem normal to close every Friday and for the one Doctor to be off every weekend. Needless to say, I still ended up being delivered by a perfect stranger. This being my 1st pregnancy, it was important that I felt comfortable but I didn't. As far as current experiences. I contacted Dr Braswell's office on several occasions because I had a concern & question about some post delivery symptoms I was still having and wanted to verify if it was a true concern. Again I felt as if she was way too busy to give me proper attention. The receptionist also made it seem as if my call didn't deserve a direct conversation with Dr. Braswell, all of which would have taken 3 minutes. It appears that once you deliver you are no longer a concern. After several times calling and excuses from the receptionists, I still have yet to receive a call back. I just gave up. All of these perfect reviews that she's getting, I'm not buying. If I were to base my review only on personality then, yes, Dr Braswell would get 5 stars. But at the end of the day, I rather have a snob who at least took good care of me and ensured that everything went well pre and post delivery.\",\n",

After waiting 1 hour and 45 minutes for my first appointment I only saw Dr. Norman on my way out after I was diagnosed with some pre-cancers. I only dealt with his Physician Assistant. They did a whole body diagnosis of my skin looking for any abnormalities. Other than pre-cancers on my face and one small basil cell cancer to be removed from my face that is all they found. Going back to the office for removal of the basil cell cancer again I did not see Dr. Norman but the Physician Assistant who also did the surgery to remove the cancer.

       "  'Unfortunately, sometimes, the best way to get the attention on an office like this is thru Yelp. We will see. I had a VERY disturbing experience with Mr. Warren Miller from Billing. Basically, I was on a conference call with my insurance company, and him, trying to figure out why my claim kept getting rejected. The insurance company told him he was using the incorrect ID# since I had changed insurance companies and he was using the new one and not the old one. He didn\\'t know I was on the line and said \"patients are so DUMB, they don\\'t tell you these things!\" I was shocked! I told him I was on the line and I had called last month about the same issue and HE told me it was fine and not to worry about the bill and he was going to reprocess it. I told him he was the dumb one not me. I have been on top of this and all of my medical bills from day 1 of my pregnancy. After the issue was resolved between my insurance company and him, I asked to speak to his office manager, Barbara. He, of course, sent me to her VM where I left my information for her to call me back. This happened today. I have not heard back from her or anyone from the office. I am sure Mr. Warren Miller was very embarrassed. He did apologize to me by saying \"sorry, I did not know you were on the line\" but that is definitely not they way to go. As a patient, we don\\'t fully understand everything to do with medical billing, that is why they are there to help us, we\\'d hope. Instead, they point fingers and blame it on you or the insurance company. I did my due diligence and contacted their billing department to make sure THEY get paid and this gets resolved. I had even called last month about this same issue and explained my situation to them. So sad to see that as a patient we do what we need to do and contact them for help and assistance and they turn around and call us dumb and offer no help at all. Mr. Warren Miller was rude from the start but I just brushed it off and assumed he was helping me as best he could. The truth was he was never even listening to what I had to say and pointed the finger at the insurance company. At the end, HE was the one using the wrong information to process the claim and now HE has to reprocess the paperwork. I am no longer a patient of this practice but I have been dealing with this since July 2015 (it is now almost November). You can have good doctors, but if your office workers treat your patients like this, they will not only be unhappy but they will leave and not recommend you to others.',\n",

       "  'I\\'ll try to keep this short, as I could most definitely write a novella about all the crap I went through to get a freaking birth control Rx. Basically, going to Dr. Vyas was a horrible experience. It should have been simple. Make an appointment, get my lady exam, get my Rx. She would run the tests, and call me if anything came back abnormal. That is how it has gone with every other doctor I have had. But, my old doctor is gone now, so I needed a new one, so I tried this doctor who is two blocks from my work. I have since learned my lesson about convenience. I would rather travel 20 miles to go to a quality doctor.My first appointment was at 10:30. I didn\\'t get called back by the nurse until 11:20. I didn\\'t see the doctor until 12:30. I got back to work at 1:00 and I was pissed. During the first meeting with her, she gave me TONS of shit about my weight (yes, I know I need to lose weight, but i\\'m not sure what that has to do with my lady exam), she second guessed every answer I gave her in regards to anything she asked (Do you have itching? No. Really? No itching? No. Hmmm.\"), she was a total smartass (Does your family have high blood pressure? I don\\'t know. Why don\\'t you know? Are you adopted??). She also went into a place that I don\\'t even let my boyfriend go, with NO warning, and when I yelped out in pain she said, \"Well, that is why you shouldn\\'t tense up.\" WTF?? At the end of that visit, she told me that she needed to draw blood and I needed to come back on Monday for an ultrasound \"because it is good to have one once in awhile.\" Huh? I have never heard of that, but okay. Oh yeah, and she wouldn\\'t give me birth control until she had all the test results back. I told her I needed it now, she said, \"You have time.\" I told her I have about seven days, and she said that I would have some before then.I went on Monday for the ultrasound, and again, was there for two hours. She told me I needed to drink 32oz of water an hour before I went. I was dying in the waiting room, I was about to burst. I finally got called back by the ultrasound lady, who was VERY nice. Why isn\\'t she the doctor? She started the exam and noticed how full my bladder was and told me I didn\\'t need to drink that much, just one glass of water would have sufficed. Thanks again, Dr. Vyas. I asked the lady what she was looking for. She said I was having the ultrasound because of the \"pain\" I had complained about. I never complained, or even mentioned pain. Way to make more money, Dr. Vyas.I went to my final appointment on Friday. I was there for another two hours. She finally came in the room and again gave me TONS of crap about my weight, like I was supposed to lose 40 pounds in five days. She obviously has her mind made up about me, without even asking me anything, because she was telling me I need to cut down on junk food, and stop drinking so much. Um...I never eat junk food and I drink wine, on weekends only. She started going over my test results. \"Your HPV test game back negative - that\\'s surprising!\" I looked at her with a WTF look and she said, \"Well, you have had so many partners. You really got lucky.\" OMG! I could go on and on about all the rude, bitchy, unprofessional comments she made to me. But, I will sum it up with this. After spending $40 in co-pays, wasting six hours in her office, and putting up with her attitude, I only got three months of birth control. In order for her to give me a year, she wants me to come back in six weeks for two more appointments (another $40 and four hours) so she can run more tests on me. No thanks! I will be going to Planned Parenthood, which is what I should have done in the first place, and I will get a full year of birth control, for free.',\n",

He explained the treatment plan thoroughly and, from the first appointment, I felt very confident he would resolve the issue with my hand.

The steroid shots did help a little, but I was still having some pain so Dr. Miller suggested surgery. I agreed.

Dr. Panitch took the time to explain what she was testing me for (I had an ear ache). She explained her findings in a way I could understand. The bottom line is this.
