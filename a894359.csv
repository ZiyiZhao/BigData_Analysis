First of all, the day I went to the office, the computer systems were down so I had to tell the staff my Name, Height, Weight (without them measuring) and they wrote it down on a blank sheet of white printer paper. I then met with the doctor and discussed my symptoms; she was very nice and suggested I get some blood work so we can begin the process of understanding what might be wrong. She mentioned that once I got my blood work results, the office would be in touch with me within 1 to 2 weeks to discuss next steps. Immediately after my appointment, I went to the lab to get my blood work. Three weeks after my appointment, I called the office to see if they received my lab work; i was forwarded to the medical staff's voicemail service: no response. A week or two later, I call again, and again, I reach voicemail and get no response. I wait yet another week and finally get in touch with someone, they say yes, they've received my results and that they needed the doctor to take a look and they would call me back in 5 minutes - guess what comes next, no call back. I finally wait one more week as at this point, I assume nothing is wrong since I'm not getting a call back but thinking I would like a second opinion. I call the office again, again I am sent to the voicemail service, but this time, I leave a very blunt message demanding my results so I can share with a doctor that actually cares about my health. Finally, on this day, I receive a call back from the office but I was in a meeting so they left a voicemail. The voicemail I received is a concerned message that they do in fact think I may have an issue and informing me that I need to get further testing completed ASAP....ASAP...6 weeks later? The only positive thing I can say at this point is that the office did mail me my lab results (the lab results they received dated a week or two of after my appointment). At this point, I of course did not go back to Sonia Gibson's office and went to another doctor for a second opinion and treatment. The funniest part of the experience is that I was charged a hefty bill for my visit. I called the doctors office a few times to dispute the charge and discuss my experience but, as I'm sure you can guess, I never did get a call back. What I did get was a notice that my unpaid bill was sent to collections...ridiculous. Unfortunately, a doctor is only as good as their staff, and this office is unorganized and does not care for their patients.

They are rude, disorganized and unhelpful, it's simply not worth it. Her office called and cancelled the appointment that I made six months ago. They told me that Lann was filled up for the rest of the year , wouldn't allow me to make an appointment with another doctor in the practice, and wouldn't put me on any type of waiting list in case someone cancelled. I explained to her that I couldn't wait another four months to see a doctor, and she told me that I should have returned her phone call earlier because they would have had appointments. She called me on Friday. I called her back on Tuesday. She claims to have left a voicemail a month ago, but I never received one. During the whole conversation she was rude and unhelpful. Finally, I told her that I would just have to see another doctor because I couldn't wait that long for an appointment, and she said okay and hung up. Previous to this, they told me they overcharged and sent me a checks to make up for the over charge, and then sent me a bill later on, for the same amount they gave back to me, saying I was overdue. SInce I work nearby, I went in the office to pay my bill, rather than send it in through the mail, and they wouldn't accept my payment because I didn't have the invoice number on me.

My son then became very agitated and frustrated so he started acting out crying and throwing a fit in the examination room. We tried to calm the situation down but it didn't work so my husband and I had had enough and told our son that we are leaving. It was at that time that the Dr. finally came into the room and heard my husband said one more time to our son we're leaving. The Dr. didn't even ask why we were leaving in fact the Dr. saw that we were picking up our son's clothes and the Dr. just left the room. Again, he didn't seem to want to know what the problem was. We were in the process of removing our son because he didn't want to leave the room a nurse assistant came over to inquire about the situation. As I was explaining to the nurse what had happened Dr. Metsch came rushing over and again not wanting to know why we were upset in the first place so he said I thought that you guys were leaving. I can't have you guys causing commotions in the hallway and if need be securities should be called to have us remove. Can you believe this? He wanted to call securites on us because we were not out of the examination room fast enough. First of all we were in the Medical ofc and not in the library. Excuse me? We were causing commotions? So my son acting out is us causing commotions and not my son just being agitated and frustrated for waiting too long? Can you believe this? This Dr. didn't seem to care why we were leaving, why we were upset. He was very arrogant. He didn't want to talk to my son and try to calm him down. He just didn't like the situation and didn't want any part of it. I can't even believe that he is a pediatrician. If kids acting out are an annoyance to you Dr. then maybe you should have picked a different profession. He misinterpreted the whole situation from beginning to end. If you have this Dr. make sure that you and your children are on your best behavior. He may call securities on you for causing commotions or your children for acting out. A side note: Kaiser have been great with us. We've always had great attentive Doctors who tends to our needs and very caring. We've been with Kaiser for almost 10 yrs.

The doctor was absolutely the most unprofessional, arrogant ,rude and just nasty person I had the misfortune of meeting. I went there for medical help for a very serious condition that requires more than one specialist.This doctor determined I only needed see her and told me throw all my medications away that other doctors painstakingly had me on ,after trial and error of many medications that had been tried and did not work. And after meeting me 5 minutes throw all that away and take what she said to take . this woman never examined me ,took my temp. checked my eyes,or checked my ears and these were two of my primary complaints, being blurred vision and ringing in the ears. Then when I questioned her on the medication she became defensive.When I asked her what degree of relief I should expect she could not even give me one reason for putting this substance in my body she didnt have a clue about the medicine or my condition.( I later looked up this medication and there are far better drugs being prescribed currently) I had asked my wife to come with me and help me remember anything I might forget .On two occasions she told her to shut up,I literally could not believe this woman was a State licensed professional, maybe in some third world.I realized the reviews I had read were obviously self written. She has no patience to understand or any concern whatsoever what a person may be going through. At some point she started demanding blood I,I told her I was dehydrated and did not feel comfortable having someone poking me with needles at that point in her little dive clinic by the quik e mart .She insisted I will have someone give you water. I knew then It was all about the billing she wanted that lab money and she didnt want to refer me to the proper specialist she didnt care if I got to the treatment I needed it was just about hooking another monthly insurance card for the billing cycle.I was in a serious accident with multiple injuries including brain injury broke hip and shoulder injuries etc. and she said I was seeing too many doctors.I will be Glad to relate my experience with the state board of medical examiners I believe her competency should be questioned. I feel She is hiding be hind her license and a complaint to the State board will have to be answered to on her part I demand the reasoning for What the State Board position on having these type people represent them. But her response to the complaint will be directed back to me and their final findings regarding this matter will also be directed to me as well. The general public should know ,that after only a very limited number of complaints to the State Board of Medical Examiners a competency hearing will be required that s why most doctors have the common sense to carry themselves properly when treating patience.",GOOGLE_PLACES.L5llssxdHNcPWiCMEoN9Zw.e2xNP_rsgu5oLd_h7L_yNQ,,0.2,

The office did call to confirm my appointment the night before, I drove 3 hours to his office, got all the way into a room to see the doctor, and nobody in that office mentioned that Dr. Kornmesser wasn't there, he was out of town. A physicians assistant came in (introduced himself as a doctor), and said he would be seeing me instead. He ""checked my injury"", moved my wrist all over, pulled on it etc. then decided to put me in a cast. After 2 weeks in the cast he put me in and intense pain (I was not in pain before my visit with him) I FINALLY got a call from Dr Kornmesser after I had left messages with the office. He said that I shouldn't be in any pain, something was wrong, get the cast off. I got the cast removed, and got an appointment to actually see Dr Kornmesser the next week. He ""checked out the injury"", put me in another cast for 8 weeks, said that's all he wanted to do with it, he didn't feel like doing the simple surgery to completely take care of the problem. Well after 5 months in a cast he told me (without evaluating again) just see how it feels in 2 weeks, and if it doesn't feel better we can try something else. He didn't look at it at all, barely gave me any information about it, and no guidelines about what I should do now. I was sent to physical therapy, it is now 4 weeks after my cast removal, and there are more problems than when I started. I am in the process of finding a doctor to find what this office did. My physical therapist says there's more damage than I started with because of the poor treatment from Dr Kornmesser and the PA that first ""helped"". I have been 6 months without the use of my arm and hand, and it's much worse than my initial injury now. I would have been way better off not going to the doctor at all. Even after all that the office still charged me for all the visits, even the one I didn't see any actual doctor. After I was referred by an orthopedic surgeon who said it was a much worse injury than he was comfortable dealing with, they should NOT have sent in a PA, and he shouldn't have lied about his credentials. I am not at all happy with this office, I should have made a full recovery in 7 weeks, and now it's 6 months later, and I have far more extensive injuries than I began with.",VITALS.5dSbSuic2SCsFyhYuWWRXA.bWHcz7HGKqHiHDuWtgwJMw,,0.2,

I feel that she is required to do these surgeries if criteria are met, but her attitude seemed to convey that is is 'grunt work"" not as important as the 'real"" surgery she does for her cancer patients and she has little patience for women needing reductions.

Until L was born I was completely happy with my visits. Dr. Sonnen has a bit of a condescending tone naturally, but I always left feeling like I had a great doctor. He was fantastic with my premature daughter. When L was born, he had a slight case of torticullis (sp?). Dr. Sonnen advised us to get in contact with the state (early childhood intervention) so that we could get discounted therapy. We had no desire to go through the state and wouldn't have qualified anyways so I chose to take L to a therapist that was recommended to me by a friend. When I arrived I found out that L's prescription (I had no idea you needed an Rx to see a physical therapist!) had not been sent over. So at the rate of $15 per 30 minutes I called Dr. Sonnen's office. I was shuffled from receptionist to nurse and was told that the Rx was not sent because L had not had a full well child exam and asking why I went to a different therapist when he had told me to go through ECI. Um, excuse me? I can take my child to any therapist I choose! He then refused to give me the Rx even though he knew I was at the therapist waiting on it. The well child appointment had NOTHING to do with the fact that my son needed the therapy that Dr. Sonnen himself had told me to get! On top of that I actually HAD taken him to the well child appointment, but had decided to hold off on his vaxes while I did a bit of research since my son was also premature. When I brought this up to the nurse she said that his well child appointment would not be considered complete until the vaccines had been given and I would not get the Rx without a complete well child appointment. Dr. Sonnen was simply upset that I was questioning the vaccines! I paid $85 to the therapist and we never actually did the therapy. I ended up heading to Care Now and explaining the situation to them, paid them another $75 for the appointment and headed back to the therapist with my Rx.

To my utter dismay and horror, I came out with having had an experimental procedure of my nostrils being cut, widened, and flipped to theoretically allow more air flow, along with much ""scrapping"" inside the passages. HOWEVER, my septum, the bone structure that is detrimentally deviated, remained unaltered...no attempt to straighten was attempted! In addition, she unbelievably botched up the routine stitches that were importantly reattaching my nostrils to my face! During recovery, there was a major gap in my right nostril where it met the skin that I immediately made an appointment and drove the hour and half to Kaiser's elite LA hospital where Lubka only worked to address. I specifically told her and showed her my many concerns that were already visually apparent with the stitching, as well as the uneven nostril alignment reattachment, and she said that my skin would heal together right on its own over her ""handy work"" and that she was trying to balance my two sides of the face better by noticeably raising my left side so it would look more symmetrical. Suffice to say, five years later, my breathing is more congested due to the inflammation around the nostrils and inside my nasal passages and my deviated septum left unfixed. My nose has very apparent and terrible looking scar tissue that is not even in a decent line, with that indented section on the right side, or as my husband says, the gapping hole. Lets not get started on the askew placement of the nostrils that has thrown off my entire features and not balanced anything. The extensive trauma to the nostrils constantly hurts and itches and I am left still trying to save for a reputable, skilled, and practiced plastic surgeon to actually FIX my deviation and now my horrible looking nose that has definitely wounded my self confidence from the perspective of a wife and wanting to take any pictures. I cannot stress enough how much I regret having Dr. Lubka even get near my nose, let alone attempt surgery on it. I should have sought out a true professional and sacrificed out of pocket to avoid a world of hurt and disappointment to then only have her tell me post-op that my family, friends, and I were all being vainly critical and my ""phantom pain"" would go away and breathing increase as time went on. She was short, defensive, unwilling to discuss, and critical for her shortcomings. Her true colors came out to late for me, but hopefully this heartfelt review can spare another!\[]",VITALS._39lqwCS9E-f4ocZ-lyeaQ.U8Unhz4D_GjYbkJlfzVGFQ,,0.2,

He gave me a code on my paperwork that my insurance said was labeled as ""routine preventative testing"" under which my coverage for that area had already been met when I had my yearly pap smear. They also said he additionally did not provide a code with enough detail as to what the testing was so they would not cover it. Dr. Salup not only was kind enough to stiff me with the bill by giving me an incorrect code, but he gave me a free speech on the issue of safe sex which I didn't know was a regular service of the gyno office? I left his office that day very offended and was even more angry when I realized for one year my bill had been bouncing around between the lab and the insurance company unpaid without my knowledge because of what he did.

In regards to Dr. Sonnenblick personally, I've always found her to be friendly, helpful, and informative. She takes her time with patients and makes them feel cared for. Unfortunately, for various reasons (as described below), I would never recommend her to anyone.In regards to her staff, I've never had a good experience. Her front office staff speak in loud voices that do not lend to patient confidentiality. They do not take responsibility for their mistakes or have sympathy for patients that have been waiting multiple hours past their appointment times. Mistakes in insurance billing are placed on the patient and any patients that express frustration are met with very aggressive responses. Her scheduling staff aren't redeeming. When I called for an emergency appointment, I was not given one. Instead I was offered one in two weeks. At which point, I was forced to go to a local emergency clinic and then the ER. Another area of disappointment is the prescriptions Dr. Sonnenblick writes. She was very kind to give me three month supply of my first oral contraceptive. However, with insurance, I was paying over $100 a month after that. When I went for a visit and requested a generic brand, she refused and said that none were available. Which leads me to insurance. I got married and changed my insurance over the course of my time with Dr. Sonnenblick. I cannot count the times I requested that my name and insurance be changed in my file. Unfortunately, they not only forgot to change my name and insurance, but their related lab sent a bill to collections in my name because Dr. Sonnenblick's office informed them that I had no insurance on file. As a result, my credit was affected. It took 9 months and over 30 phone calls to clear up. No apologies were offered. I'm very sorry to say that I stayed with her practice until I got pregnant. Dr. Sonnenblick does not accept new OB patients, because of her obligations to her young family (admirable). After visiting my new OB's office for my first appointment, I signed a Release of Records. The next day Dr. Sonnenblick's office called me to inform me that they would not release my records unless I was willing to pay a large fee (allowable by state law) for reproduction costs. They charged the maximum the law would allow. Kindly, they offered to send my most recent records only, free of charge- which does no good when you are pregnant. I conferred with my lawyer and he suggested that I request a digital copy of my medical records. The office out and out refused, which is illegal. This final offense is why I am writing this review. To refuse OB treatment to a pregnant woman, then require a hefty payment in order for that woman to receive treatment elsewhere is cruel. Shame on that office.

929646141,false,finalized,3,4/11/2016 21:23:41,bedside_manner,1.0,"Dr Jeffrey Ihlendorf seems like a very nice man. He waitied and listened to my healtcare needs. However I won't be going back to see him as I will explain. But in summary, Dr Jeffrey Ihlendorf seems to be a very booksmart young new graduate type doctor who has not yet developed a functional level of clinical judgement to treat patients on an individual level rather than simply parroting the latest published guidlenes from a journal article. Here is my experience with Dr Jeffrey Ihlendorf. I was new to the area and needed to establish a relationship with a MD as my primary care doctor. First let me say I am a clinical pharmacist that has been practicing in a clinical environment for nearly 10 years; often writing prescriptions under a doctors authority. Albeit, a pharmacist does not have prescribing rights in the state of Indiana, I know a little about what medications are, and how they can be prescribed in a proper and appropriate way. I use a combination of Flovent and albuerol to control mild asthma. Dr Jeffrey Ihlendorf decides that my Flovent should be the primary means for controlling my astham and decides to prescribe ONLY ONE albuterol inhaler for the ENTIRE year. No refills allowed! No additional quatity alloweed. At first I thought this was a mistake because as a pharmacist I spend alot of my working life clarifiying prescription quatities on prescriptions written by busy doctors when they don't match up with an appropriate rate of consumption. I called back to the office and asked for the new prescription with updated quantitiy be sent to my pharmacy. Dr Ihlendorf's nurse called back and said this was the quatity the Dr had written because he felt that using more than one inhaler of albuterol in the course of the year would indicate that the Flovent dose needs to be adjusted. I explained many many many various reasons why this was inappropriate as follows:1.) I often keep one inhaler at work and one at home2.) Occasionally one inhaler gets lost or left in my car where the heat causes it to spoil3.) Even with all the high costs of medications now-a-days, albuterol is a generic and is basically very inexpensive so this is in no way inflating the costs of my health care to my insurance provider.4.) In additon to being an allergic response to dust mite feces, my asthma is also excercice induced and, as a runner, I often use it almost daily when I have excersion based bronchoconstrition.5.) Albuterol in an inhaler form is actually a very mild way of consuming the product because this medication is produced in a much more concentrated nebulized form and used at doses that are ten fold higher for patients with severe bronchoconstriction for a multitude of conditions so simply consuming more than one inhaler a year would be inappropriate limitation for a patient that uses it regularly.6.) I use the albuterol prior to dosing with Flovent as a pre-treatment to facilitate better penetration of the corticosteroid Flovent 7.) I have been on this exact therapy and consumption since I was a teenager and many many doctors have continued to prescribe this without any problem8.) Albuterol is not some addictive habit-forming drug of abuse so this is not some attempt to support an addictive drug habit. The nurse states she will check with Dr Jeffrey Ihlendorf and call me back with his response. The next day, the nurse called back and stated that Dr Jeffrey Ihlendorf's conclusion was the I should simply be limited to ONLY ONE inhaler for the ENTIRE year and that no additioanal quatities would be prescribed. I subsequently made the drive to my old town to see my old prescriber for a yearly exam and to have my scripts renewed for the year. I had to pay two insurance co-payments but got back on track with a medically appropriate therapy. Won't be going back to him again.",VITALS.a--inLq1C1XQBX1ONuiQMA.9XVDTjExp0ky7UUL5R8cVg,,0.2,

I didn't want to see Saucedo but there was no wait in the waiting room and I was really uncomfortable and nervous about the reaction I was having. I was taken back right away.

Ask you what's going on and then proceeds to over talk you and not listen to what you tell him. His famous line is give me a sec and I'll be right back. He me never comes back. Not even when you've asked to see him again. The nurse appeared about 20 minutes after he left and said I was free to go! She had 3 prescriptions for me. One of which I was allergic too. I told her twice I was allergic to one of the meds he gave me to counter react the allergic reaction. I should add the allergy is in my chart. She had no idea what the other 2 were and I was given no instructions. By this time I was miserable and angry. She informed me they had nothing to treat a reaction there but after some more yelling I was finally given a oral Benadryl which I could've taken at home. I continued to itch and I broke out in hives until 4 am the following morning. My scripts were never called in to the 24 hour pharmacy.

Why is a drug being injected into people epiduraly when the package insert clearly states ""NOT FOR EPIDURAL USE""? At minimum, informed consent should be obtained from each patient. This is something that I never received. I have also learned that ESIs are extremely dangerous. Several people have even died from ESIs. Arachnoiditis is also another very serious complication that may result from ESIs. I was never informed of any of these potentially very serious complications from ESIs.

He had no answers for why this was happening or if it was linked to endometriosis, which another doctor had diagnosed me with. After my D & C he never did a follow up on my levels or prescribed me pain med, or did any testing as to why I had miscarried. When I got pregnant again and subsequently miscarried a few weeks later I didn't even see him even though I called to speak to him several times. He did no testing of my progresterone or hcg levels to monitor the pregnancy. I talked to his nurse through the whole thing. Once I miscarried I demand that my levels get tested because he wasn't going to do it. He never did a follow up or anything, so needless to say I am seeing another doctor that actually speaks to me!",VITALS.CwiPbEfForjeFl-EcXzxwA.fW-POtX_vlEVvtLkzJK_iA,,0.2,

However, he never looked into the cause of the extra fluid. My daughter was born with a major heart defect and sealed nasal passages caused by a genetic syndrome. He didn't see that during any of my 3 ultrasounds? We could have consulted cardiology and delivered at the hospital that knew what to do! When she wad a year old, he told me the syndrome she had been diagnosed with was ""made up"" by the hospital so I would think they knew what they were doing. He asked if I would do an interview on film about my daughter and her experiences. During this, he told me that I needed to take better care of my husband, and that my belief that my children always come first is wrong. My husband should always come first. A week later, he called me to say that he had discused my case with his peds friends and they all agreed that my daughter was unsalvageable, and I should just concentrate on my ""two good kids"".

0.4246","Run, do not walk, away from this doctor. He is perhaps the most incompetent doctor we have ever run across. We were referred to him by the Georgia Crisis and Access line because my son was in crisis. He needed medication management. To begin with, Dr. Richardson was rude and condescending to us. Beyond that, he has absolutely no grasp on medications that are used to manage psychiatric conditions. He was using some small book to look up dosages and various medications. That did not make us feel very confident. Then, he made 2 changes to my son's routine at the same time. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that THAT wasn't a smart thing to do. Because then, we didn't know if it was decreasing the first medication or adding the second which, again, he did simultaneously.Following this change, my son ended up in a crisis home and Dr. Richardson has YET to return our call.

0.6349","First off, I had to wait 45 minutes for an appointment. I had an appointment with Dr. Andrew J. Feldman. After I went to the room, someone came in and asked me questions. He was not a nurse, and he did not introduce himself. Later on, I looked up the name on his coat, and it turned out this guy wore someone else medical coat. Anyways, after this guy asked me questions, he aggressively squeezed my two knees and I asked him where is Dr. Feldman, and he said he is on his way. This guy asked for XRAYS. After I did the XRAYS, I waited in the room for 20 minutes. The guy comes back and says that he was talking with other people regarding my situation and concluded I needed knee replacement surgery. A man who is wearing scrubs and looks like a bum from the street, unshaven beard, unkept hair enters the room. The first thing he says is that ""oh, you look scared."" It turned out that was Dr. Feldman. Feldman did not say anything else, he just sat on a seat and let the guy who's name I never found out determine my condition, it turns the guy was a resident. Feldman has a terrible condition where he mixes up the left and right knees, he misread my xrays. If you do not believe me, he was sued by a dancer because he operated on a wrong healthy knee. Anyways, after he consulted with his resident and ignored me completely he told me with no emotion or sympathy, everything you will try like physical therapy and injection will fail, you need knee replacement surgery immediately. Worst experience ever. This guy does not look or act like a doctor and is extremely stuck up and is rude. Also, I would like to note, I went to a different doctor the next week, and the new doctor told me I do not need knee replacement right away, maybe after 5 years.",VITALS.zAQMVdfhDu7xawJbjknFaw.Q6Decctl7gVeehpusXfeiQ,,0.2,

The lump was lanced open approximately 6 inches and I was told it would heal from the inside out. After 2 to 3 weeks a wound care nurse red flag emailed Handman telling him there was a problem with the wound and said he would see me at my appointment with the physician assistant wound care specialists of which he failed to show. Two weeks after that another surgeon at Kaiser was summoned by the PA because she felt something was wrong and the new sugeon agreed. I was scheduled for surgery to remove the open lump that had grown bigger than a golf ball that night and had 6 1/2 inches of my side removed. Since this began other lumps formed throughout my body but was diagnosed as lipomas. Four days later I was told by phone from my urologist that I had been diagnosed with (Stage 4) non hodgkins lymphoma.

He falsified documents to my insurance stating that all conservative treatments had been tried and failed, when I'd had NO conservative treatments whatsoever. I'd only had an MRI and CT done by my primary care doctor who saw the problem and referred me to him. He placed a graft sideways through a vertebrae and INTO my spinal canal, then closed me up as if all was good. It was NOT. I haven't seen him since my surgery, as he stood me up for all of my post-op appointments. I had to keep rescheduling since there was always an excuse for why he couldn't see me. On a few occasions, I even heard him in the next room speaking with the nurse telling her which excuse to tell me because he didn't want to see me!!!! He is a coward who wouldn't face up to his mistake. I did 6 months of physical therapy, only to get worse. My physical therapist even attempted to contact him multiple times to say that there was something wrong and he needed to see me. My legs go numb and go out from under me because of this. The worst is that I have unbearable tailbone pain, which I never had before my surgery. Later, another neurosurgeon explained to me that he is very bad about retracting too far which stretches the nerves to a point they cannot heal, resulting in excruciating tailbone pain, and there is nothing anyone can do to treat it! I finally got a second opinion where the neurosurgeon showed me where the graft was in my spinal canal and actually pinching it. My spinal canal came down, was pinched off around my graft, then went on down. It looked like a line that went down, bent all the way over to one side, then bent back and continued down. I had to have a revision immediately to redo the graft and get it out of my spinal canal. The neurosurgeon told me how sloppy Dr. Good man's work was and that he had a lot of ""clean-up"" to do once he was in there. I still have horrible, debilitating back pain, and now I cannot find a neurosurgeon who will take my case once they find out he's the one who did my original surgery. As a matter of fact, I was scheduled for surgery, and when I met with the surgeon for him to explain the operation, he told me it was brought to his attention that Dr. Goodman did my first surgery, then said he didn't think surgery would help and refused to do the surgery he had already scheduled. He had seen my scans, my history, everything, and scheduled the surgery, but when he found out who did my first surgery, he then refused to go in after him. RUN as far away from Dr. Goodman as you can! I'm not the only one he has screwed up indefinitely either. Once everything was revealed as to the problem, I began getting bombarded with horror stories about surgeries he's done!

A few months after his dangerous ""advice"" my PSA began to rise. After 6 months it continued to go up. I had a biopsy which showed some aggressive cancer in the prostate and had surgery 2 weeks ago.

He didn't offer to try any conservative measures (like my 2nd doctor said he should have done before jumping to surgery), and basically just wanted me to hurry and consent to the surgery. Not knowing any better, and being used to trusting a doctor, I signed. He screwed up my back surgery, put a piece of hardware in incorrectly, making me worse than before the surgery. I STILL have not seen him since my surgery. Every appointment I had with him afterward, he stood me up. I called several times, and ONE time received a voicemail from him that my scans showed that the hardware was perfect. After waiting in his office for several appointments and STILL not seeing him, I decided to get a second opinion. I was in physical therapy from the surgery and even my physical therapist was telling me that something wasn't right and tried contacting Dr. Goodman, with no response. I got a second opinion and immediately the doctor knew what the problem was. He showed me the MRI and you could clearly see the malpositioned hardware, where it had protruded into my spinal column, and where it was screwing up the nerve causing excruciating pain. I had to have another surgery immediately to take out the hardware Dr. Goodman placed in me, and have it redone correctly. I now have pain all day, every day, and nothing helps. He really screwed up and gave me permanent nerve damage. What's worst of all is that he couldn't even own up to his mistake, stood me up, said everything was fine, and left me completely helpless until I found my amazing new doctor.

My father, a cancer patient, saw Dr. Calapai for ""natural cancer treatment"". Dr. Calapai's approach is based on a study that finds low dose targeted chemo to be successful by using insulin to allow the cells to receive the low dose chemo. He supposivly bases his treatment on results from blood work that is sent to Greece for testing. The therory of what he offers is fine and may in fact work but Dr. Calapai is so money hungry that he really only cares if he gets payment for as much treatment as possible. Let me explain - to send the blood work to Greece cost my elderly father several thousand dollars. Nothing was done with the results from the testing. Instead, my dad went to Dr. Calapai's office for weekly or twice weekly Multi-vitamin treatments (which they call poly MVA) which he paid for out of pocket. My dad was under the impression that this could help him get stronger but in fact it did nothing and my dad deteriorated and eventually died from cancer. My dad could not afford the ""low dose chemo"" (he had already paid thousands to Dr. Calapai) and instead of Dr. Calapai saying to him that without the chemo part of the treatment (ie with only the poly MVA) really it's a waste of his time and he should seek treatment elsewhere. Bottom line is I'm keeping an open mind to the treatment of low dose chemo (even though it's alternative treatment) but you can't pretend that expensive vitamin infusions are going to cure cancer while you watch your patient get weaker and weaker every visit (1-2 times per week). My dad was just a source of income to Dr. Calapai. He had no concern for my fathers well being.",U_COMPARE_HEALTH_CARE.zcsSyA56aL4yL9IZJHjbzw.rv-9035229,,0.2,

I called to advise them that you cannot put a past due amount on someone's credit report when it's less than 30 days past due, and asked why they had not processed my payment. I was informed that it takes 3 weeks for them to process a mailed payment. No they could not take the payment over the phone, and they don't know why the website won't accept my account information. You read that right: They take 3 weeks to process a payment by mail, there is no other way to pay them, but 2 weeks after they bill you they will send you to collections and report to the credit bureaus that your bill is delinquent. There is no possible way to go to this hospital and NOT lose points on your credit score. No one in their billing department can explain to me how their policy makes sense. They claim that they will sort it out once they get around to processing my mailed in payment, but even if I was bleeding to death, I might drive a little further to avoid this place. Edit: They did finally process my payment over a month after it was mailed. The payment was one payment of the full amount. They mailed me a receipt for payment of the full amount.

When I told him that something was wrong, he never took me seriously and he told that I ""had to work through the pain"". I asked for testing and to be referred to someone else, but he said there was nothing wrong. He then performed a manipulation, which made things worse. I couldn't even lift my leg, but he told me, again, to work through the pain. I switched doctors and was immediately told that Dr. Tuttle's manipulation had severed my quad tendon, but Dr. Tuttle totally missed it, simply saying I had to exercise more! The other doctor had me tested and found that I was allergic to the bone cement that Dr. Tuttle had used. I was never even tested for allergies to it before the replacement! It took two years of fighting with Dr. Tuttle's office and working through referrals to get the problems addressed. During this time, my tendons had shortened and I had to endure unimaginable pain! The second doctor performed another knee replacemet and found that the cement had never hardened because my body had rejected it. The knee was simply moving around!! Had I stayed with Dr. Tuttle I would have been forced to continue to endure horrendous pain. He never took my complaints serious and refused to test me further. As a result, my knee will never be right because of the shortened tendons. If you want a nice person, go to this doctor. If you want a good surgeon, run away!

First of all, there is NOTHING pediatric about this place and I laugh that Dr. Sackett is a pediatric doctor because he was horrible with the kids. When I first got there they needed to weigh my child in case they needed to sedate her for surgery. Because she had a broken leg she could not stand on a scale....it was as if they had never weighted a child with a broken leg before because they couldn't figure out how to do it. Eventually they decided to weight me while was holding her and then weight me again while i put her down and subtract...it was wierd! Secondly, the patient room is basically one big room with a bunch of Dr. beds in it. This is obviously not good for little kids because my daughter was scared enough as it was and then she had to sit there and watch other children screaming while they got their cast on and off....this did nothing to help her out and calm her nerves when it was her turn.I think I was most upset with Dr. Sackett himself. He was very rude and short with me....barely even having time to tell me what was wrong with my child. He basically came in, told me she needed a cast, and then left. I had to call him back in to ask him questions. He then told me there was a chance my child's leg could grow crooked and if it did ""it wasn't his fault""....ummm, ok?!? He didn't feel the need to give me any more details or statistics on this pretty major issue! Finally, during my follow up visit when my daughter was suppose to get her first cast off and her second cast on Dr. Sackett came in with her x-rays, told me her leg healed great and gave me the directions on how to take care of it at home. I was thrilled she didn't need to get another cast on....only to find out as we were leaving that he had the wrong patient the whole time. He was giving me the report for a different patient!!!!!!

0.5279","Even with another orthopedic referring me to this doctor it took two weeks to get an appt. I was excited after my first appt. because I thought she could really help me. She spent time with me going over my MRI and showing me some abnormalities. I was thrilled. I have battled the same problem with my back for 5 years. I have 3 year old twins and a 6 year old and I thought I was finally going to get relief. I left her office that Friday morning under the impression she was scheduling me for a sacroiliac injection asap due to the amount of pain I was in. Her scheduler finally called me on Thursday, almost an entire week after my first appt. The injection was scheduled for not that coming Monday, but the next Monday. Over two weeks from the day of my first appointment. I was very frustrated by this because she had assured me that she understood how much pain I was in and that she would have her scheduler get me in that coming week. She even had me stop taking some of the meds that I would have to stop taking 1 to 3 days before the procedure. I received a packet in the mail that had some info about the injection but I still had questions. I thought I would have an opportunity to talk to her before the procedure but I never had a chance. I had also explained to her that I have panic disorder and would need something to calm me down before I went back so that she could put it in my chart and I wouldn't have a problem with the nurse taking care of it. She failed to mention anything in my chart about it and the nurse had to page her to get permission to give me something, by this time I was already having a panic attack. They took me back to a room and had me lie on my stomach. My gown was completely open in the back. I remained there for 15 to 20 minutes with 2 female nurses and 1 male nurss before Tibiletti ever came in. She finally arrived, asked if I needed anymore medicine to calm me down, (as I'm hyperventilating), told the nurse to give me more and stuck a needle in my back a couple of times. She told me how good I was doing and that it was supposed to be very painful. She said that was good because it meant the medicine was in the right spot. She removed the needle and her gloves and was off on her merry way to torture someone else. No ""are you ok, do you have any questions, thanks for lining my pockets"", nothing. They take me back out, the nurse explains this ""pain diary"" I'm supposed to fill out and mail back and I'm sent home. No relief. As each day passed I hoped to finally get relief, but it actually got worse. By day 3 I called the office and spoke to Tibelitti's nurse. I wanted to know if it should be hurting worse and what I could do for the pain. Pain meds aren't working. I was told to do the pain diary and mail it in and we'd go from there and to take my pain meds if I need them. Duh, been taking them since I left. Called day 4 to leave msg for Tibiletti because I wanted to ask her some questions and I'm told she doesn't have voicemail and they can't take a message because she's at a conference. If my pain is too bad I'm told to go to the local ER. Mailed my pain diary in and her nurse called me on day 10 to let me know that the doctor is recommending 2 more injections, was I ready to schedule. I told the nurse that I'd really like to leave a message for the doc to call me and she told me that ""Dr. Tibiletti doesn't make personal phone calls."" If I needed to ask her a question I would have to schedule an appt. I will schedule one more appt. with the doctor but it will be the last. Luckily, I have great insurance and didn't waste a lot of money. I'm not a negative person and I have only stated facts. I'm sure she is a good person and hopefully has been able to help other people. I just wanted to put this out there because knowing what I know now I would have looked harder for a doctor.

First of all, the office told us our appt was at 9 (turns out it was at 10) but they lied to me to get us there early so we could fill out the mountains of paper work. I typically get to an appt 15 min early so our wait was 1 hour 15 min. Apparently after talking to the other patients, this is standard practice. When we finally got back to talk to the Dr,. he wouldn't even make eye contact and suggested we drill on my 14 yr olds ankle to stimulate the bone growth. When I asked if there were other alternatives, he said that is what we needed to do (at this point, with the opulence of the office, the many staff members, all the stations of fee payments etc I was wondering if an unneeded surgery might be paying for his yacht). Needless to say, I planned on getting a second opionion. So we had to go through 2 more stations to exit. Dr. Sackett had suggested we get an MRI. I questioned the cost of the MRI to the office lady and she confided in me that it was way overpriced here ($3,500 vs the $500 I paid at a local imaging place). I guess this is just another way he chooses to get more kick backs in fees. Well, I was so angered by the overpricing and obvious lack of patient care, that I forgot to take my xray with me (that was on CD). So I called to ask them to mail me my CD. They mailed me a CD but it was of some guys hand! I didn't find this out til my second opinion visit and that was another complete waste of my time since they couldn't even look at the xray. I guess the only thing good that came from this experience is they said they would pay for my second opinion appt. I would NOT recommend this office for anyone as I feel they are totally motivated by money and I would never trust this Dr. with my daughter's well being. (As a side note, turns out my chiropractor fixed the ankle jam and lack of circulation in her ankle.) They had way too many patients to keep up with everyone. Way too big of a practice to offer any individual care. This is a prime example to me of what is wrong with American medicine these days.

I rushed to my primary care physician and made all paperworks fixed to Dr. Lucacz same day. Next day, I have received a call from Dr. Lycacz office saying that they need another approval from a cardiologies. It was just impossible to schedule an appointment with cardiologist during these few days before the surgery. Dr. Lycacz has three months to review my case, but she decided to do everything in a last minute. My personal impression is that Dr. Lucacz does not care about patient convenience and wellbeing.

She was supposed to be a dermatologist who was sure to shed some light on my skin breakouts, itching , and rash ; which mainly occurred on my arms and legs. She didn't help me at all , and didn't seem to care. I was unable to get an appointment right away , while the rash was on me,fully broke out . All there was on me were the white marks that the rash often left in between frequent breakouts. She was more concerned about her two week trip she was taking than looking at my skin to find my skin problem. She left me with a feeling that I will never find out what is wrong with me . All her front desk wanted to do was collect money from me, even after I told them I had plenty of money on our HRA account. I left feeling like she didn't care nor want to help me . Don't go here. I still have problems, and am afraid to seek any more help from physicians who don't care.",YELP.zBH77isUNpOGE_Z8Wy3How.wwCHiJxVXIZzvmYUwlOrag,,0.2,

I later found out from our INR nurse that this is not the case, and many people have done this before. When asked if there was any way my father would be able to walk again, the doctor shook his hands in my father's face and said to get a walker. He did not discuss any type of pain management (which was one of the reasons why we were there) and he did not discuss what could be done if we decided to pursue treatment and go off the medication. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Not only was he rude and insensitive, he did not try to accommodate my father's needs. The only bright spot was his physician's assistant, who was the only thing that made this trip bearable.

He falsified documents to my insurance stating that all conservative treatments had been tried and failed, when I'd had NO conservative treatments whatsoever. I'd only had an MRI and CT done by my primary care doctor who saw the problem and referred me to him. He placed a graft sideways through a vertebrae and INTO my spinal canal, then closed me up as if all was good. It was NOT. I haven't seen him since my surgery, as he stood me up for all of my post-op appointments. I had to keep rescheduling since there was always an excuse for why he couldn't see me. On a few occasions, I even heard him in the next room speaking with the nurse telling her which excuse to tell me because he didn't want to see me!!!! He is a coward who wouldn't face up to his mistake. I did 6 months of physical therapy, only to get worse. My physical therapist even attempted to contact him multiple times to say that there was something wrong and he needed to see me. My legs go numb and go out from under me because of this. The worst is that I have unbearable tailbone pain, which I never had before my surgery. Later, another neurosurgeon explained to me that he is very bad about retracting too far which stretches the nerves to a point they cannot heal, resulting in excruciating tailbone pain, and there is nothing anyone can do to treat it! I finally got a second opinion where the neurosurgeon showed me where the graft was in my spinal canal and actually pinching it. My spinal canal came down, was pinched off around my graft, then went on down. It looked like a line that went down, bent all the way over to one side, then bent back and continued down. I had to have a revision immediately to redo the graft and get it out of my spinal canal. The neurosurgeon told me how sloppy Dr. Good man's work was and that he had a lot of ""clean-up"" to do once he was in there. I still have horrible, debilitating back pain, and now I cannot find a neurosurgeon who will take my case once they find out he's the one who did my original surgery. As a matter of fact, I was scheduled for surgery, and when I met with the surgeon for him to explain the operation, he told me it was brought to his attention that Dr. Goodman did my first surgery, then said he didn't think surgery would help and refused to do the surgery he had already scheduled. He had seen my scans, my history, everything, and scheduled the surgery, but when he found out who did my first surgery, he then refused to go in after him. RUN as far away from Dr. Goodman as you can! I'm not the only one he has screwed up indefinitely either. Once everything was revealed as to the problem, I began getting bombarded with horror stories about surgeries he's done!

My husband mentioned a painful bodily issue I had experienced and Dr. Lee completely cut him off. He was somewhat dismissive regarding my pain issues following surgery done by Dat Tien Nguyen. He commented that I should simply be happy that the two breast lumps were not cancerous and basically to get over it; meaning the injuries and pain. I told him I was grateful the lumps were not cancerous, yet my pain was unbearable and I had blood oozing from my nipple. After he saw the blood coming out of my nipple he seemed to understand my pain and issues were legit. He did order blood work and an ultrasound, which was good. He reaffirmed what other pain specialists had told me; the nerve damage suffered during Nguyen's surgery would be with me for life. The nerve pain was and IS in my breast and runs down into my ribs. I told Dr. Lee I had seen Dr. Peter Wong at Tri Valley Physicians about a week prior to my visit with him. I told him Dr. Wong prescribed an antibiotic for an infection, which I soon learned I did not have. Dr. Lee also reaffirmed that patients should not be treated with antibiotics if they do not have an infection; as was my case. Keep that in mind folks; be certain you actually DO have an infection before being treated for an infection. I had the ultrasound performed, yet wasn't called with the results as promised. I called his office and an employee, Frida took my message regarding the test results. Frida (hope I am spelling her name correctly) was a gem. She is a nice lady, compassionate and very professional. She gave Dr. Lee my message, yet he still failed to call with the test results. I called again the following day, as I'd been waiting on pins and needles for the test results. Frida said my test results were setting on his desk and had been for a couple days. I could tell she was frustrated too that he had not yet called me. Finally, Dr. Lee did call with the test results, yet he did not speak to me. Instead he left very detailed, private medical testing information on my answering machine. I was livid when I retrieved the message. I called him and expressed being angered by him leaving the detailed  testing results on my answering machine for my children to hear and he did not care. ...HIPAA violation.

She had the worst bedside manor, and had me screaming in tears when giving an exam, she is very aggressive and did not care about the well being of my son and I. After 20 hours of labor she decided it was time to perform a C-Section. She gave me no warning, and no information on what to expect. The reason for my c-section was high blood pressure (on my part) causing my sons heart rate to drop. The reason for this, was her attitude and demeanor while i was in labor. She was short, and rude with me, resulting in a lot of tears and frustration, causing my blood pressure to spike. I have permanent nerve damage (some of which is normal) but I have numbness up to my belly button (which is not normal). She was sloppy in my surgery. At the very beginning her and her team of doctors gave my the numbing meds,and tested my feeling. I verbalized that I still had feeling on one side and was told ""no you don't""... I felt her cut my stomach open, a feeling that i will never forget. I screamed bloody murder and was put to sleep resulting in me not being able to see my son when he was born, and due to the meds, I didn't meet him until he was a few hours old because I could not open my eyes or lift my arms. Before surgery I asked if I would have stitches or staples, and was told stitches. Coming out of surgery, I was told I was given staples, and I later found out that she had never performed this type of staple, causing a very embarrassing, long exam trying to figure out how to take the bandage off and get them out.

This sling holds my arm in the WRONG POSITION and THEY NEVER TOLD ME THEY LOST MY SLING AND GAVE ME THE WRONG ONE. Are you kidding me??! I just paid you to do my surgery and you lose my sling and dont even tell me. They wanted me to come in as soon as the office opened the next day to get the right sling, but NO ONE EVER TOLD ME THAT EITHER. The nurses SWEAR they wrote it down in my packet, but I have looked numerous times and they never gave me any after surgery instructions. I found out I had the wrong sling and I was supposed to come in for the correct one when the passive-aggressive nurse, Judy, called me at 4:50 PM the next day. I was horrified and wanted to come in as soon as possible to get the right sling so my shoulder does not get injured, but I could not come in because they were going to close in ten minutes. Judy then blamed me for not knowing to come in and not having the right sling. ARE YOU KIDDING ME AGAIN? IT IS YOUR JOB TO MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT LOSE MY SLING AND TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO AFTER SURGERY. You do surgeries all the time, how can you be so incompetent and unprofessional? So then the next kick in the balls is I go back a few days later to get the dressings taken off and the physician assistant comes in and asks how my exercises are going. What?!!!! I was supposed to be doing exercises, why didnt anyone tell me?!!!! Now I am horrified again that my shoulder will have permanent damage from not doing any exercises for a week. The doctor also swears that the nurses told me (I have multiple people who can attest that they told us nothing). So after showing me the exercises I ask the doctor if they have a how-to sheet to make sure I remember to do the exercises correctly, well he looked at me like I was crazy. Oh, Im sorry that you do not have print outs of after surgery instructions and exercises to help your patients because all you do is surgeries. That is insane. I have had other torn muscle surgeries and I always get pages explaining all of the after surgery care and the exercises to do BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT COMPETANT DOCTOR OFFICES DO. I do not even know how often to do the current exercises. The doctor did not tell me that and I was too mortified to remember to ask. I will never go here again and I recommend that you stay away. There is so much miscommunication between the doctors, the nurses, and the patients that I am honestly surprised that they did the surgery on the correct shoulder.

Yes at times the bacteria can become reistant and even changes its form and tricks the immune system.but a dr. switches to a different antibiotic,many times one has to use a combination.Strange how one can receive for yrs. antibiotics for acne, tuberculosis, leprosy which borrelia even in rare situations mimic some of leprosy skin symptoms.

Lyme can affect every organ of the body. It all depends on one's genetic weakness.Plus we do know there have been deaths from Lyme disease. What is going on within this disease is evil.

Even though this was still in the block of time he had reserved for seeing me, Dr. Hernandez did not come out right away. I waited and waited, checking in with the receptionist twice. At 3:55, I finally informed them that I was going to need to reschedule the appointment because I had to leave at 4:15. I did not think that 20 minutes (or probably less, the way things were going) was going to be sufficient for what had originally been an hour-long appointment. It was only at this point that Dr. Hernandez actually came out to the waiting room to speak to me. He tried to convince me to stay longer than 4:15 so that we could do the appointment. I replied that I couldn't, at which point he offered a brief apology and no explanation for keeping me waiting.

Next AM he has a Doctor (that did not JUST do surgery to find out you messed up your diagnosis Alcantara) that my mother has never met-walk in and inform her/us that ALL the doctors do not want to have her there and they ALL want her to move hospitals to another Doctor THEY choose. All of them, ...oh really. Guys Make sure this guy knows and loves you before he discards you for questioning his huge ego. Apparently if you ask questions, you don't like him and are questioning his ""doctor elite-ness"" so be careful.

Why call me if you do not want to take the time to discuss my results!Recently, I called the office for a week trying to get prescriptions transferred to a new pharmacy. After five calls to the office during a one week period, she finally returned my call. During each phone call, I left a message explaining what I needed from her. She decided on her own that I could take a generic drug vs. the name brand even though I thoroughly explained that I had many ill effects to the generic version. During our conversation, she said ""Of course you can take the generic. The insurance company won't pay for the name brand."" This was not true since I had spoken on several occasions to my insurance company and they told me that Dr. Friedlander just needed to fill out a form stating that I could not tolerate the generic. In fact, my insurance company faxed her the form. But she proceeded to do what she wanted to do rather than what I asked her to do.In regards to transferring the existing prescriptions which had remaining refills, she refused to do so until I made an appointment to see her. I told her that I did not see the purpose for another office visit since I had just seen her for my yearly physical three months ago at which time she wrote the prescriptions. It was apparent that she just wanted to get paid for an office visit that was not necessary. And lastly, the doctor completed our phone conversation by hanging up on me.In my opinion, Dr. Friedlander is very disrespectful, rude, acts like she is very stressed and cannot take pressure.

I should have cut bait and switched PCPs from the get got--from the moment I called to make an appt. His wife took the call and repeatedly told me I would have to schedule 2 appts in order to be seen in their office per my insurance. What?? She kept assuring me it was STANDARD procedure that you made one appt. to fill out your paperwork and get vitals and then your 2nd appt. (That would be 2 paid appts.) You would be seen by the dr and get a check up. I went round and round with her on the absurdity of this. I hang up and call my insurance (Blue Cross Blue Shield) to verify this ""policy"" and complain. Of course that's not an insurance ""rule"". I call back and just like that his wife says, ""Ok. I'll just schedule you for a physical in one appt."" That was my first 30 minutes lost and my first red flag. I show up for my scheduled appt. and sit in the waiting area for 1 hour and 22 minutes before being taken back to an examination room. Why I didn't walk out is beyond me. At some point you invest so much time that you decide to stick it out. ..Should have just left. My bad. No real opinion on the Dr because he really didn't say much to me. He was in an out within 10 minutes. I spoke to him regarding some concerns I had and wanted to establish on my chart. However, there was no real follow up on his side. Had labs done in the office (which is a plus), however, they put down the wrong insurance information. That is a talent considering I filled out my insurance forms, my insurance electronically sends my info to their system as my PCP, and they made a copy of my insurance card. So, with all this info already in my file, how does one manage to put in the wrong insurance? So, another delay as the staff tries to ""figure out"" how this happens. They send me to check out with no instructions or follow up regarding anything I discussed with the Dr. Is he is going to prescribe me anything or send me to a specialist? I have no idea. I ask the check out person to follow up with anything from my appt. Nothing. She has no idea and there isn't a nurse available to tell me anthing. There is nothing on my chart reflecting anything. Great. So I check me out. NO receipt, no info., no anything. I walk out with nothing. After a week I followed up regarding my in office labs, since no one ever contacted me. The person on the phone tells me she doesn't do lab results but will get the info for me since I am calling and asking. I explain to her no one has ever called, I wasn't given any info. during or after the appt., and the the ""NextGen Patient Portal"" the receptionist tells you to sign up on doesn't have any info on it. Why exactly to they tell you to sign up on the NextGen Portal if they don't actually put any of your info on it? They give me the results over the phone and tell me I need to do this and this. I ask for a copy of my labs and instructions and have yet to ever receive anything. I followed up asking about a health concern I voiced to the Dr. that he never said anything in the appt. and apparently didn't note in my chart. The person on the phone said she would ask and call me back--and of course, never did. I am astounded when people keep putting down all these glowing reviews of this office.

The appt was delayed so that the providers could get their flu shot without anyone saying a word to me about the reason for the delay. When she walked into the procedure room she was eating. She briefly washed her hands and and made a comment about my being allergic to latex and stated she had her own gloves, the nurse said something about the ""new gloves"" required to be used, then when I started to tell her my symptoms and concerns, she cut me off and stated her assumption that all of my problems were related to taking pain medication (prescribed by another KP doctor) before ever doing an assessment. I felt judged, belittled and not cared for. I was not adequately sedated and was awake through both of the procedures, at certain points writhing in pain without even a kind word, just told to be still. After the procedure she did go over the results but she was more focused on the fact that the sedation did not work than my results or current status. The exam showed I had Inflammation throughout my upper gi tract, diverticulosis and many polyps, some were sent for biopsy but after a week I still did not have the results. There was no followup made by the GI department as to my well being or test results and I was told to followup in 2 years and to take a probiotic along with another medication I was already taking, Protonix, prescribed by my PCP, and to go through anesthesia departmentfor my next exam. She showed absolutely no empathy or concern for my well being. Being told they did more than 14,000 procedures last year and average 65 a day in the 10 procedure rooms at this facility, I felt like cattle being prodded. I am a health care professional, and RN and am appalled at the treatment provided by this person.

I waited about 45mins before I was let in to see her, and then she spent less than 5mins with me. I was a new patient, so you would assume that there is a lot to learn about me, but she came into the room, and barely asked me any questions. She barely even touched my ab to see what the issue was. All she did was told me to get some blood work, to see what the issue was. I don't even understand what the purpose of me being there was for. Since she barely even looked at me, all this could have been done over the phone. Then later, after I got my bill for almost $250 for 5mins, I called to discuss the bill, and the staff was not helpful or responsive. After about 4 conversations w/ the staff, I asked to speak w/ Dr. Carreon personally, so that I can solve the problem quicker. Can you believe what her staff told me? ""The doctor will not speak to patients over the phone. She will only talk to you if you are in the office"". What type of doctor is this??? I've had many other doctors during my 30 or so years, and a GOOD doctor would always take time to speak w/ a patient, especially if they had a question or concern. Dr. Carreon's time however is so ""valuable"" that she is unwilling to spend even a couple mins on the phone w/ me to clarify this issue. Again, another example of a BAD doctor. From all these examples, all I can say is that Dr. Carreon is a doctor who only cares about money, which is proven by her unwillingness to talk w/ you unless you are in her office, and she can bill you for her time.
